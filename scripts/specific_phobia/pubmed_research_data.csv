A Novel Hypnotic Intervention for the Treatment of Ornithophobia. A Case Study.,Vivo Deborah R,The International journal of clinical and experimental hypnosis (2025),"This case study explores the successful treatment of severe ornithophobia in a 25-year-old woman, referred to as Emma, through a novel hypnotic intervention that integrates mindfulness and autogenic training. Emma's chronic fear of pigeons had significantly impacted her professional life. The Severity Measure for Specific Phobia-Adult (SMSP-A) was used to assess her level of phobia pre- and post-intervention, as well as at a 6-month follow-up. Emma's hypnotizability was measured using the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale - Form C (SHSS:C). Following a single hypnotic session, Emma experienced accidental physical contact with a pigeon. This incident activated the resourcefulness response elicited during hypnosis, leading to an instant healing of her phobia. This positive outcome not only persisted but showed further improvement at follow-up. Additionally, Emma resumed her university studies and overcame her driving phobia. These findings suggest that the intervention was efficacious in treating Emma's ornithophobia and promoting her overall personal growth. The study provides a comprehensive account of the intervention and discusses its implications for treatment.",40748612,specific phobia

Taxonomy of anxiety disorders-a comparison of ICD‑10 and ICD‑11.,"Domschke Katharina, Zwanzger Peter",Der Nervenarzt (2025),"With the introduction of the 11th revision of the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), structural and content-related adjustments to the diagnostic guidelines for anxiety disorders were made, which are presented in this review article. Previously classified as ""phobic disorders"" and ""other anxiety disorders"" within the group ""neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders"", in ICD-11 ""anxiety- or fear-related disorders"" now constitute a separate group. The core diagnoses of agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are retained, with the modification that agoraphobia and panic disorder can now be diagnosed separately and comorbidly. Within the framework of the lifespan perspective, separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been moved to the group ""anxiety- or fear-related disorders"". The diagnosis ""mixed anxiety and depressive disorder"" is now classified as ""mixed depressive and anxiety disorder"" in the group ""affective disorders"". In accordance with the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‑5), it is possible to code isolated panic attacks in addition to other mental or somatic disorders. Overall, ICD-11 follows the DSM‑5 classification of anxiety- and fear-related disorders in many respects. Furthermore, the omission of subcategorizations and a precise minimum number of required symptoms simplify the diagnostic criteria. Future studies will need to address questions regarding the diagnostic accuracy, clinical practicability and further operationalization of the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for anxiety- or fear-related disorders.",40728738,specific phobia
The Act of Measurement: The Influence of Behavioural Tests on Spider Fear and Disgust.,"Peters Jacqueline, van Wonderen Anne, Visser Renée M, Kindt Merel",Journal of psychopathology and behavioral assessment (2025),"Behavioural assessments offer clinically relevant insights into anxious symptomatology, complementing self-report questionnaires in monitoring treatment effects. However, as a behavioural test is a form of brief exposure, it might not solely measure distress, but also influence it. In this study, we investigated whether measuring spider avoidance behaviour changes spider-related distress. Seventy-five individuals with a broad range of spider fear provided self-reported fear and disgust ratings, using the Spider Distress Scale, before and after engaging in a tarantula and in a house spider behavioural approach task (BAT). We found that self-reported fear, but not disgust, decreased after engaging in the behavioural assessments. A subsequent exploration within low- and high-fear subgroups showed that this pattern was driven by low-fear individuals, as in high-fear individuals spider fear and disgust remained unaffected by the behavioural assessments. Spider fear did not decrease on two exploratory questionnaires. In principle, these findings are promising for the validity of behavioural assessments in translational research where sub-clinical samples are typically targeted. However, they emphasise the need to carefully translate laboratory findings to (sub-)clinical populations, not only due to varying fear levels, but also because behavioural assessments may be experienced differently in the context of a treatment study.",40704338,specific phobia
Emetophobia (fear of vomiting): A meta-analysis.,"Meule Adrian, Seufert Leonie, Kolar David R",Journal of anxiety disorders (2025),"Emetophobia refers to a specific fear of vomiting. There are only few original research studies on this condition and no study that has meta-analytically synthesized findings to describe the characteristics of persons with emetophobia. To this end, we extracted data from 31 reports and-as we examined different dependent variables-each meta-analysis was based on five to 21 samples. The pooled mean age of persons with emetophobia was 29 years but was reduced to 21-27 years when adjusting for publication bias. The pooled mean age of disorder onset was 10 years. The pooled proportion of females was 91 %. The pooled proportions of reporting fear of vomiting oneself, fear of seeing others vomit, or both, were 47 %, 11 %, and 39 %. The most common comorbid mental disorders were social anxiety disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. The pooled point prevalence of emetophobia was 5 %. Higher emetophobic symptomatology moderately related to higher disgust propensity and higher anxiety, and weakly related to higher depressive symptomatology. This meta-analysis is the first to quantify that most adults with emetophobia are in early adulthood but the disorder started in childhood, almost all are women, the primary locus of fear is vomiting oneself, the most common comorbid mental disorders are other anxiety and affective disorders, and higher emetophobic symptomatology relates to a more general tendency to be easily disgusted and to be anxious. Studies based on representative samples to obtain reliable estimates on the prevalence of emetophobia are needed.",40700922,specific phobia
Emetophobia treatment with subconscious-facilitated exposure-response prevention: a review and case report.,"Lancaster Mac E, Anbar Ran D",The American journal of clinical hypnosis (2025),"Emetophobia (fear of vomiting) is a persistent and severe specific phobia that can cause significant dysfunction in everyday life. It is an understudied phobia for which there is no manualized treatment method. The most commonly used technique for treating emetophobia is CBT involving exposure therapy. In this case report, we present a 15-year-old who underwent a variety of treatments used for emetophobia and OCD related to his phobia, and anxiety, beginning at the age of 5 years. Nonetheless, the patient's anxiety intensified significantly during adolescence. He began relying on his parents' reassurance multiple times a day to ensure he was safe. Despite the patient's engagement in traditional forms of exposure-response prevention (ERP) therapy, his symptoms were only greatly decreased following subconscious-facilitated ERP (sERP), defined as a hypnotically facilitated procedure wherein the patient's subconscious directs spontaneous imaginal exposures without conscious initiation. The novel use of hypnosis to facilitate sERP outlined in this paper may function as a workaround in the case of conscious resistance to ERP treatments. More research is needed to define the potential of sERP in the treatment of emetophobia.",40680060,specific phobia

Support on four paws-does the integration of a therapy dog reduce anxiety and increase positive affect in spider phobics during in vivo exposure therapy?: study protocol for a parallel randomised controlled trial of two groups to compare one-session in vivo exposure treatment of spider phobia with and without a therapy dog.,"Braun Moritz Nicolai, Michael Tanja, Equit Monika, Lass-Hennemann Johanna",BMJ open (2025),"Exposure is a central component in the treatment of a range of mental disorders. However, despite high efficacy and efficiency, dissemination of exposure-based treatments is limited. Important factors that contribute to this limited dissemination are negative beliefs about exposure on the part of the public, the therapists, and the patients. While patients perceive exposure therapy as burdensome, therapists are concerned about putting too much strain on their patients during exposure, leading to suboptimal delivery of exposure. In a previous study, in which healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, we found initial evidence that the integration of a therapy dog into exposure reduces participants' anxiety and increases participants' positive affect without causing poor treatment outcome. Thus, the integration of a therapy dog into exposure might be a promising approach to address patients' and therapists' concerns and, thus, to (1) foster dissemination of exposure that is (2) delivered in an optimal manner. To scrutinise our findings in a clinical sample, we designed the present study. We test the following hypotheses: (H1) participants in the dog group report significantly less anxiety during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. (H2) Participants in the dog group report significantly more positive affect during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. (H3) Participants in the dog group report significantly higher therapy motivation than participants in the control group. (H4) Participants in the dog group report significantly lower anticipatory anxiety than participants in the control group. (H5) The treatment in the dog group is not inferior to the treatment in the control group.",40664416,specific phobia

Characteristics of and treatment outcome in inpatients with emetophobia and other specific phobias.,"Adrian Meule, Zisler Eva M, Metzner Michael S, Voderholzer Ulrich, Kolar David R",Journal of psychiatric research (2025),"Emetophobia refers to a fear that oneself or others might vomit and is classified as a specific phobia in current diagnostic manuals. However, it is a relatively unknown and understudied mental disorder. Although it has been speculated that emetophobia might differ from other specific phobias (e.g., in terms of severity), studies on this are virtually non-existent. Thus, this retrospective study analyzed data at admission and discharge from 70 persons with emetophobia and 40 persons with other specific phobias who received a cognitive behavioral therapy-oriented, multimodal inpatient treatment (76.4 % female; mean age 22.7 years, SD = 12.4). Nearly 80 % of persons with emetophobia were female, more than half were adolescents and underweight, and the most common comorbid mental disorders were other anxiety disorders and depression. Compared to inpatients with other specific phobias, persons with emetophobia were younger, had a lower body weight, had higher phobic anxiety, and reported lower life satisfaction at admission. Across both groups, body weight increased with a small effect size and anxiety-related, depressive, and general psychopathology decreased and life satisfaction increased with medium-to-large effect sizes. In conclusion, the current study replicates findings about certain features of persons with emetophobia and is the first study that documents differences between persons with emetophobia and persons with other specific phobias, indicating that emetophobia partially represents a more severe type of specific phobia. Despite these differences, persons with emetophobia and persons with other specific phobias achieve similar and substantial symptom reductions during a multimodal inpatient treatment.",40543409,specific phobia
Trypophobia discomfort depends on viewing context manipulation.,"Pipitone R Nathan, Stefanczyk Michal M",Acta psychologica (2025),"Trypophobia is the extreme negative reaction to clusters of circular objects. The present preregistered study investigates how context impacts trypophobic reactions through basic situational priming / cognitive appraisal paradigms. Participants were randomly assigned to view trypophobic imagery under one of three conditions: no prompt (control), art gallery exhibition (distraction from trypophobia), or trypophobia-inducing. Results showed that trypophobic reactions depended on rater's level of trypophobia, but also on the situational context. Both high- and low-trypophobic individuals were more comfortable in the trypophobia-inducing context compared to their respective control group. Low-trypophobic individuals found the art gallery condition images the most uncomfortable to view, while high-trypophobic individuals found this condition to be the most comfortable to view. Providing social context or trigger warnings led to less viewing discomfort for those who were strongly-trypophobic. Although age and anxiety levels did not impact the main findings, we found that both play a small role in trypophobic manifestation. Considering age, we argue that older age might be responsible for lower trypophobic tendencies compared to the social learning model of trypophobia. To summarize, these results show that trypophobic reactions can be affected by context, which may help future clinicians and those severely impacted by such imagery.",40527132,specific phobia

Disrupting fear memory reconsolidation in individuals with fear of spiders with cTBS: A Proof-of-Concept Study.,"Herrmann M J, Schaub D, Ziegler G C, Mühlberger A, Cybinski L M",Behavioural brain research (2025),"Anxiety disorders can be effectively treated with both cognitive behavioural therapy and psychopharmacological interventions. However, only 50 % of patients demonstrate significant benefits from these approaches. Therefore, investigating strategies to improve treatment effectiveness or develop novel therapeutic approaches remains an important research objective. Current therapeutic modalities may leave the original fear memory intact, potentially leading to symptom recurrence over time. In contrast, the disruption of reconsolidation processes can facilitate permanent modifications to fear memory, resulting in a reduced risk of relapse after psychotherapy. Recent laboratory studies have shown that the reconsolidation of experimentally induced fear can be effectively disrupted by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and significantly prevents the return of fear. In this study, we translated these results to participants with elevated fear of spiders. 34 participants with spider fear were randomly assigned to a verum or a placebo intervention using continuous theta-burst stimulation (80 % of resting motor threshold) applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ten minutes after the reactivation (3 min confrontation with a living tarantula) of the spider fear memory. The ANOVA for the primary outcome (Spider Phobia Questionnaire, SPQ) resulted in a significant effect of time, but no significant interaction of time and treatment group. Notably, exploratory analyses revealed a significant correlation between stimulation intensity in the verum group and the reduction in spider fear. This association suggest that rTMS-induced disruptions of reconsolidation may serve as a viable therapeutic option for anxiety disorders; however, further research is needed to delineate the optimal parameters for such interventions.",40383201,specific phobia
Prevalence and comorbidity of mental disorders among young adults with a history of residential youth care - a two-wave longitudinal study of stability and change.,"Greger Hanne Klæboe, Kayed Nanna Sønnichsen, Lehmann Stine, Jozefiak Thomas, Lydersen Stian et al.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience (2025),"Among youth in residential youth care (RYC) there is a high load of experienced adversities and a high prevalence of mental disorders. Less is known about the stability and change of mental disorders and whether individual or contextual factors that are protective of adult mental disorders could be identified. The current study is a 10-year follow-up of young adults with a history of RYC in Norway. At baseline (T1), 76% met criteria of a mental disorder. At follow-up (T2), diagnostic psychiatric interviews were conducted by phone by experienced doctors and psychologists. A response rate of 52% was achieved (n = 157). Criteria for at least one present mental disorder were fulfilled by 77.6%. The most prevalent single disorders were PTSD (42.1%), agoraphobia (33.3%), social phobia (27.9%), major depressive episode (23.1%), specific phobia (21.1%), and ADHD (19.2%). Most participants had more than one mental disorder. Among those with a diagnosis at T1, completing high school was the only factor found to be associated with no diagnosis at T2 (p = 0.019), whereas no statistically significant association was found with sex, age at first placement and received aftercare. We found a very high prevalence of mental disorders and a high rate of comorbidity comparable to the prevalence at baseline. This shows high stability of psychopathology from adolescence into adulthood. Ensuring access to high quality mental health services for young adults with a history of living in RYC is important. Prevention and early intervention, such as aid to complete education, should be prioritized for young people with high risk of developing mental disorders. Response rate, sample size and selection bias are discussed as possible limitations to the study.",40287873,specific phobia
"Enhanced Performance Monitoring as a Transdiagnostic Risk Marker of the Anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum: The Role of Disorder Category, Clinical Status, Family Risk, and Anxiety Dimensions.","Härpfer Kai, Carsten Hannes Per, Kausche Franziska Magdalena, Riesel Anja",Depression and anxiety (2025),"In this preregistered study, we investigated the relationship between neural correlates of performance monitoring and disorders of the anxiety and obsessive-compulsive spectrum. Specifically, we aimed at understanding the role of disorder category, clinical status, family risk, and the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal. To this end, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) of performance monitoring (i.e., error-related negativity, ERN, and correct-response negativity, CRN) in a large sample of 156 participants, including groups of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia, as well as a naturalistic control group. Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not observe significant differences in ERPs among the clinical groups, nor in comparison to the naturalistic control group. However, after creating a more strictly defined healthy control group, we found larger ERN amplitudes in the specific phobia compared with the healthy control group. In addition, when comparing participants with and without a lifetime clinical diagnosis of any internalizing disorder, regardless of their main diagnosis, as well as when comparing those with or without a family risk for internalizing psychopathology, we observed larger amplitudes for both ERN and CRN. Subsequently, we combined data from this study and a previously published subclinical study to examine the role of transdiagnostic symptom dimensions (i.e., anxious apprehension and anxious arousal) across a wider severity spectrum. In this joint sample of 246 participants, gender emerged as a moderator of the link between anxious apprehension and enhanced performance monitoring. Specifically, women with increasing anxious apprehension exhibited elevated ERN and CRN amplitudes. In conclusion, our study challenges the notion of a disorder-specific link to performance monitoring. Instead, our findings suggest that enhanced performance monitoring is associated with a higher propensity for anxious apprehension and acts as a broad risk marker for internalizing psychopathology, reflecting vulnerability beyond diagnostic borders within the anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive spectrum.",40259892,specific phobia
Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Symptoms are Common and Impairing in Adults With Specific Phobia of Vomiting: An Exploratory Study in an Understudied Population.,"Zickgraf Hana F, Murray Helen Burton, Rigby Andrea",Psychological reports (2025),"Patients with specific phobia of vomiting (SPOV) often avoid foods or restrict eating aiming to prevent vomiting. However, the prevalence and correlates of avoidant/restrictive eating characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in individuals with SPOV is unknown. We aimed to examine the frequency, correlates, predictors, and detection of ARFID secondary to SPOV in adults. Adults with SPOV recruited on vomit phobia Reddit forums (N = 276) completed measures of (1) eating restrictions associated with ARFID, (2) ARFID symptoms and their perceived causes, and (3) SPOV severity, clinical impairment from eating, depression and anxiety, and candidate predictors of ARFID in a SPOV population. Forty eight percent of participants met full self-reported ARFID criteria and 27.5% met criteria for subthreshold ARFID. Participants with full-ARFID reported significantly higher levels of SPOV, depression, and anxiety, while all ARFID-endorsing participants reported greater clinical impairment from eating and dimensional symptoms of fear- and appetite ARFID than participants with SPOV only. Fear of food was the only candidate predictor independently associated with ARFID status. ARFID symptoms were extremely common among adults with SPOV who seek support in online forums. ARFID symptomatology was associated with greater impairment and comorbidity compared to SPOV alone. Future research is needed to understand if targeting ARFID symptoms in treatment improves outcomes for SPOV.",40256877,specific phobia
Integrated multimodal analysis for high-accuracy anxiety disease subtype classification.,"Chen Ying, Tang Yibin, Ni Qinghua, Gao Yuan, Wang Chun",Psychiatry research. Neuroimaging (2025),"In this study, we propose a classification method for identifying subtypes of anxiety disorders (AD). A large dataset is built with 108 healthy controls and 179 subjects from four primary AD subtypes: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), and specific phobia (SP). We calculate diverse multimodal data, including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and voxel-based morphometry, and create brain gradient data to provide a comprehensive representation of these data. For subtype classification, we develop a hierarchical binary hypothesis testing (H-BHT) framework with a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, we use a traditional BHT method to identify AD individuals. In the second stage, we categorize AD subjects into different subtypes under multi-class hypotheses. Our experiments demonstrate that the gradient data outperforms single-modal data in subtype classification, achieving an impressive 97.9% accuracy. When performing a multivariate analysis of variance on the brain regions associated with the discriminative gradient data, it reveals significant biomarkers among the subtypes, including the insula, amygdala, orbital inferior frontal, middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyri. These regions are strongly correlated with emotion control, providing substantial support for the pathogenesis of existing AD subtypes and confirming the validity of our method.",40245748,specific phobia
Psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ADHD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Njardvik Urdur, Wergeland Gro Janne, Riise Eili N, Hannesdottir Dagmar Kr, Öst Lars-Göran",Clinical psychology review (2025),"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with estimated worldwide prevalence of 7.2 % in children and adolescents. Comorbidity of psychiatric disorders is considered common in ADHD and has been found to contribute to poorer prognosis. Despite decades of research, the actual prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD is unclear. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the prevalence of comorbid disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. Embase OVID, Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO were systematically searched for eligible studies published up to February 2025. In total 121 studies involving 39,894 children and adolescents with ADHD diagnosis were included. The most common comorbid disorders were Oppositional Defiant Disorder (34.7 %), Behavior Disorders (30.7 %), Anxiety Disorders (18.4 %), Specific phobias (11.0 %), Enuresis (10.8 %), and Conduct Disorder (CD) (10.7 %). All individual disorders studied had a higher prevalence among children and adolescents with ADHD than in the general population. Few gender differences were found; higher prevalence of CD among boys and higher of OCD in girls. The findings indicate that comorbid psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in children and adolescents with ADHD and must be considered in both assessment and treatment of ADHD.

Early hypervigilance and sustained attention for the eye region in adolescents with social anxiety disorder.,"Hauffe Vera, Rauschenbach Anna-Lina, Fassot Eva-Maria, Schmitz Julian, Tuschen-Caffier Brunna",Journal of anxiety disorders (2025),"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating affliction that typically manifests during childhood and adolescence. While theoretical models of adult SAD emphasize the role of attentional biases, little is known about maintaining factors during childhood and adolescence. The objective of our eye-tracking study was to determine whether youth with SAD exhibit a hypervigilance-avoidance pattern of visual attention for faces. To this end, we used a free-viewing paradigm to present angry, happy, and neutral faces, and non-social object stimuli to three groups of adolescents aged 10-15 years: SAD (n = 57), specific phobia (SP; n = 41), and healthy controls (HC; n = 65). A screen-based eye tracker recorded gaze behavior and pupil dilation. Among participants, only older adolescents with SAD exhibited shorter latencies of first fixation to the eye region compared to HC. Contrary to our expectations, there were no differences in duration of first fixation to the eye region among the groups. Instead, compared to HC, older adolescents with SAD showed longer dwell times on the eye region during the first 1000 - 3000 ms of stimulus presentation. No significant differences among the groups were found regarding scanpath length or pupillary reactivity. Taken together, our findings suggest early hypervigilance followed by sustained attention to the eye region in older adolescents with SAD, which may indicate difficulties in disengaging attention.

Ready for translation: non-invasive auricular vagus nerve stimulation inhibits psychophysiological indices of stimulus-specific fear and facilitates responding to repeated exposure in phobic individuals.,"Szeska Christoph, Klepzig Kai, Hamm Alfons O, Weymar Mathias",Translational psychiatry (2025),"Recent laboratory research showed that vagus nerve stimulation promotes fear extinction, the inhibitory core mechanism of exposure treatment, presumably via activation of the noradrenergic brain system. However, a translation of this stimulation technique to clinical practice is lacking. We therefore investigated the potential of vagal stimulation to inhibit excessive fear responses and facilitate responding to in-vivo and laboratory exposure in individuals with specific phobia. Spider-phobic participants were subjected to three standardized in-vivo exposures towards a living tarantula, complemented by an exposure in vitro (between exposure in vivo I and II). Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) was applied during in-vitro exposure, presenting pictures of the exposed tarantula, other spiders and neutral tools in the laboratory. Fear was assessed by self-reports and behavioral avoidance (in-vivo exposures), and amygdala-mediated autonomic and behavioral fear components (exposure in vitro). Vagal stimulation facilitated the reduction of behavioral avoidance across repeated in-vivo exposures. During laboratory exposure, taVNS inhibited fear tachycardia and corrugator muscle activity specifically in response to pictures of the previously exposed tarantula - an effect that became stronger with increasing stimulation duration. Psychophysiological indices of noradrenergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala were elevated during taVNS and correlated to subsequent attenuation of behavioral avoidance. Our results suggest, that taVNS exerts stimulus-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of multiple automatic response components of excessive fear, highlighting taVNS as a valuable adjunct to exposure-based treatment. A translational mechanism of action is supported, proposing that taVNS exhibits its effects by noradrenergic activation of fear extinction circuitry, particularly targeting the basolateral amygdala.",40204704,specific phobia

Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Efficacy in Anxiety Disorders: A Scoping Review of fMRI-Based Studies That Tested the Dual Model.,"Domínguez-Pérez Judith, Peñate-Castro Wenceslao, Rivero-Pérez Francisco Luis","Life (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Anxiety disorders are common mental health conditions characterized by excessive fear and anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy, yet the possible neurobiological mechanisms underpinning its effects remain debated. The dual-route model offers a potential explanation by suggesting that CBT increases activation in the brain areas responsible for emotion regulation while decreasing activation in limbic areas. This scoping review examined possible neurobiological mechanisms supporting CBT's efficacy in anxiety disorders by exclusively reviewing studies that utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The included studies published since 2018 focused on adult samples that received CBT for anxiety disorders, with pre- or post-treatment fMRI data. The data extraction followed a standardized process, with key variables, such as the study design, population, and neuroimaging findings, systematically charted. While the dual-route model explains key aspects of CBT's neurobiological effects, the findings suggest the need for expansion to incorporate areas such as the precuneus, particularly in specific phobias and social anxiety disorder. Further research is required to refine this model and explore additional mechanisms underlying CBT's efficacy.",40141837,specific phobia

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants with contamination- and animal phobia (N = 49) were randomized to active tDCS (1.7 mA, 20 min; n = 27), or sham tDCS (1.7 mA, 30 s; n = 22), followed by a single session of 30 min of IVE. Active tDCS targeted excitation of the left mPFC and inhibition of the right dlPFC. BPM and HRV were acquired during behavioral approach tasks involving brief (30 s) exposure to feared targets at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a 1-month follow-up, as well as during six 5-min. trials of exposure. Active tDCS produced significantly greater reductions in BPM, and marginally greater increases in HRV from pre-treatment to 1-month in an extinction context, compared to sham tDCS. Similarly, active tDCS produced significantly greater reductions in BPM, and increases in HRV during IVE, relative to the sham tDCS group. Findings for the generalization context were non-significant. Consistent with the main outcome findings, tDCS may offer an effective means of enhancing outcomes in exposure therapy, perhaps through top-down modulation of autonomic arousal.",39904156,specific phobia
Long-term exposure therapy outcome in phobia and the link with behavioral and neural indices of extinction learning.,"de Vos Jette H, Lange Iris, Goossens Liesbet, Leibold Nicole K, de Cort Klara et al.",Journal of affective disorders (2025),"Extinction learning is regarded as a core mechanism underlying exposure therapy. Under this assumption, studies have looked at the predictive value of the extinction learning paradigm for exposure therapy outcomes. However, predicting factors of long-term exposure therapy success have not been established. Participants with a specific phobia (SP) for spiders were included in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive exposure therapy (n = 25, 24 females) or an active control intervention, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR; n = 18, 15 females). Symptom levels were measured with the Fear of Spiders questionnaire (FSQ) at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and at six- (T2) and twelve (T3) months follow-up. At baseline, participants completed a three-day fMRI fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction recall paradigm. Indices of extinction were defined as self-reported threat expectancy and fear, and neural activation during stimulus presentations and threat omission in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, based on prior data. Mixed model analysis revealed that the exposure therapy group had an overall stronger decrease in phobic symptoms over time than the PMR group (β = 10.95, p < .001). However, none of the indices of extinction learning were predictive for FSQ scores after exposure therapy at the longest follow-up measurement (T3).

"Benefits of the ""worst-case scenario"": a multi-level examination of the effects of confronting the feared outcome during imagery-based exposure.","Jessup Sarah C, Armstrong Thomas, Rast Catherine E, Woronko Sarah E, Jackson Mitchell et al.",Cognitive behaviour therapy (2025),"Exposure therapy is an efficacious treatment for anxiety-related disorders. Yet, fear often returns after treatment. Occasional reinforcement, in which the feared stimulus is intermittently presented during extinction, increases safety learning and slows fear renewal in conditioning paradigms and analogue samples, but no studies to date have examined this strategy in clinical samples. The present study examined the effects of vicarious occasional reinforcement on fear renewal in a snake-phobic sample across multiple levels of analysis. Fear was intermittently reinforced by providing reminders of the feared outcome (a snake bite) throughout a two-session analogue video exposure manipulation. Snake-phobic adults were randomized to one of three conditions: a single-cue [S], multiple-cue [M], or multiple-cue+fear-outcome [M+FO] exposure group. Results showed the three groups did not significantly differ in threat expectancy or attentional bias for threat at follow-up. Despite sustained anxiety, however, the M+FO condition completed significantly more steps on a visual avoidance task at follow-up than the M and S conditions and heightened mean distress during exposure mediated this effect. The M and S groups did not significantly differ in visual avoidance at follow-up. These findings suggest incorporating reminders of the feared outcome into exposure may be an effective strategy for increasing inhibitory retrieval.",39882772,specific phobia

The two sides of Phobos: Gray and white matter abnormalities in phobic individuals.,"Grecucci Alessandro, Scarano Alessandro, Fumero Ascensión, Rivero Francisco, Marrero Rosario J et al.","Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience (2025)","Small animal phobia (SAP) is a subtype of specific phobia characterized by an intense and irrational fear of small animals, which has been underexplored in the neuroscientific literature. Previous studies often faced limitations, such as small sample sizes, focusing on only one neuroimaging modality, and reliance on univariate analyses, which produced inconsistent findings. This study was designed to overcome these issues by using for the first time advanced multivariate machine-learning techniques to identify the neural mechanisms underlying SAP. Specifically, we relied on the multimodal Canonical Correlation Analysis approach combined with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to decompose the structural magnetic resonance images from 122 participants into covarying gray and white matter networks. Stepwise logistic regression and boosted decision trees were then used to extract a predictive model of SAP. Our results indicate that four covarying gray and white matter networks, IC19, IC14, IC21, and IC13, were critical in classifying SAP individuals from control subjects. These networks included brain regions, such as the Middle Temporal Gyrus, Precuneus, Insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex-all known for their roles in emotional regulation, cognitive control, and sensory processing. To test the generalizability of our results, we additionally ran a supervised machine-learning model (boosted decision trees), which achieved an 83.3% classification accuracy, with AUC of 0.9, indicating good predictive power. These findings provide new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of SAP and suggest potential biomarkers for diagnosing and treating this condition.

Fears Worth Testing Out: A Systematic Review of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Outcome for Anxiety-Related Disorders.,"Aupperle Robin, Berg Hannah, Armstrong Jacob",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences (2024),"With the advent of human neuroimaging, researchers were drawn to the idea that by better understanding the human brain, more effective mental health interventions could be developed. It has been more than 20 years since the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were conducted to examine changes in brain activation with anxiety-related treatments and more than 60 studies have since been published in this vein. For the current review, we conduct a systematic review of this literature, focusing on adult studies using task-based fMRI to measure brain activation changes with pharmacologic or psychotherapy interventions for phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroscientific theories of anxiety-related disorders and their treatment have focused on prefrontal-insula-amygdala networks. Treatment-related decreases in amygdala and/or anterior insula activation were identified as the most consistent finding across disorders, with the most consistent results reported for specific phobia. Directionality of change and specific regions implicated in the prefrontal cortex were inconsistent across studies. The potential importance for probing other networks and processes as mechanisms of anxiety treatment was recognized, such as striatal regions underlying inhibitory learning or reward responsivity. Future treatment-fMRI research related to anxiety disorders would benefit from larger sample sizes, use of more nuanced computational approaches, and increased focus on replication. There is continued promise that fMRI research will enhance our understanding of how treatments work and inform the evolution of more effective or personalized mental health treatment.",39671067,specific phobia

Anxiety and body-focused repetitive behaviors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of comorbidity rates and symptom associations.,"Barber Kathryn E, Cram Isabella F, Smith Elyse C, Capel Leila K, Snorrason Ivar et al.",Journal of psychiatric research (2025),"Body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB) disorders, including hair pulling disorder (trichotillomania [TTM]) and skin picking disorder (SPD), frequently co-occur with anxiety disorders, but reported comorbidity rates vary widely. Additionally, research on the relationship between anxiety and BFRB symptoms has yielded inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis and systematic review examined (1) the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders in individuals with BFRB disorders and (2) correlations between anxiety and BFRB symptom measures. The study protocol was pre-registered on PROSPERO. A systematic search of PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 119 studies (N=15,902) reporting anxiety prevalence rates in BFRB disorders and/or correlations between anxiety and BFRBs. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, including subgroup analyses for TTM and SPD, and meta-regression to examine potential moderators. Results indicated that comorbid anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety, panic disorder, and specific phobia, were relatively common in BFRBs. Current prevalence rates were 19.2% for GAD, 12.8% for OCD, 10.6% for social anxiety, and 27.5% for 'any anxiety disorder.' Lifetime prevalence rates were 22.4% for GAD, 13.8% for OCD, 11.0% for social anxiety, and 35.9% for 'any anxiety disorder.' Pooled correlations between anxiety and BFRB severity were low to moderate (all BFRBs r=.29; TTM r=.27; SPD r=.34). Anxiety symptoms showed stronger correlations with focused BFRB measures (r=.42) than automatic (r=.15). These findings highlight a nuanced relationship between anxiety and BFRBs. While comorbid anxiety disorders are frequently observed in BFRB populations, anxiety severity is only modestly associated with BFRB severity.

The phobic brain: Morphometric features correctly classify individuals with small animal phobia.,"Scarano Alessandro, Fumero Ascensión, Baggio Teresa, Rivero Francisco, Marrero Rosario J et al.",Psychophysiology (2025),"Specific phobia represents an anxiety disorder category characterized by intense fear generated by specific stimuli. Among specific phobias, small animal phobia (SAP) denotes a particular condition that has been poorly investigated in the neuroscientific literature. Moreover, the few previous studies on this topic have mostly employed univariate analyses, with limited and unbalanced samples, leading to inconsistent results. To overcome these limitations, and to characterize the neural underpinnings of SAP, this study aims to develop a classification model of individuals with SAP based on gray matter features, by using a machine learning method known as the binary support vector machine. Moreover, the contribution of specific structural macro-networks, such as the default mode, the salience, the executive, and the affective networks, in separating phobic subjects from controls was assessed. Thirty-two subjects with SAP and 90 matched healthy controls were tested to this aim. At a whole-brain level, we found a significant predictive model including brain structures related to emotional regulation, cognitive control, and sensory integration, such as the cerebellum, the temporal pole, the frontal cortex, temporal lobes, the amygdala and the thalamus. Instead, when considering macro-networks analysis, we found the Default, the Affective, and partially the Central Executive and the Sensorimotor networks, to significantly outperform the other networks in classifying SAP individuals.

Thirty-three participants (Mage = 28.75 years, SD = 8.98; 21 women) with self-reported specific phobia (spiders, snakes, and pointed objects) and their matched controls (Mage = 28.38 years, SD = 8.66; 21 women) took part in the experiment. The participants were instructed to initially focus on a picture in the center of the screen, then search for a target picture in an outer circle consisting of six images, and respond via a button press whether the object in the target picture was oriented to the left or right. We found that phobic individuals show delayed disengagement and slower decision times compared with non-phobic individuals, regardless of whether the stimulus was threat-related or neutral. These results indicate that phobic individuals tend to exhibit poorer attentional control mechanisms and problems inhibiting irrelevant information. We also confirmed a threat-unrelated shared feature effect with complex stimuli (delayed disengagement when an attended stimulus and an unattended target share common stimulus features). This process might play a role in various experimental setups investigating attentional disengagement that has not yet been considered. These findings are important, as good attentional control may serve as a protective mechanism against anxiety disorders.",39388014,specific phobia

Resting-state functional connectivity in anxiety disorders: a multicenter fMRI study.,"Langhammer Till, Hilbert Kevin, Adolph Dirk, Arolt Volker, Bischoff Sophie et al.",Molecular psychiatry (2025),"Anxiety disorders (AD) are associated with altered connectivity in large-scale intrinsic brain networks. It remains uncertain how much these signatures overlap across different phenotypes due to a lack of well-powered cross-disorder comparisons. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate differences in functional connectivity (FC) in a cross-disorder sample of AD patients and healthy controls (HC). Before treatment, 439 patients from two German multicenter clinical trials at eight different sites fulfilling a primary diagnosis of panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (PD/AG, N = 154), social anxiety disorder (SAD, N = 95), or specific phobia (SP, N = 190) and 105 HC underwent an 8 min rsfMRI assessment. We performed categorical and dimensional regions of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses focusing on connectivity between regions of the defensive system and prefrontal regulation areas. AD patients showed increased connectivity between the insula and the thalamus compared to controls. This was mainly driven by PD/AG patients who showed increased (insula/hippocampus/amygdala-thalamus) and decreased (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/periaqueductal gray-anterior cingulate cortex) positive connectivity between subcortical and cortical areas. In contrast, SAD patients showed decreased negative connectivity exclusively in cortical areas (insula-orbitofrontal cortex), whereas no differences were found in SP patients. State anxiety associated with the scanner environment did not explain the FC between these regions. Only PD/AG patients showed pronounced connectivity changes along a widespread subcortical-cortical network, including the midbrain. Dimensional analyses yielded no significant results.

Yet, many fearful individuals recognize their fear is not justified. Drawing on memory competition/multiple representations theory, we developed a novel, fear-relevant procedure, which reveals conflicting representations of threat. In three experiments (Experiment 1, N = 49, Experiment 2, N = 47, Experiment 3, N = 75), fearful and non-fearful participants not only provided Probability Ratings for fear-related outcomes in a fear-relevant exposure task, but placed Bets, with payoffs depending on what happened in reality. Fearful participants displayed much higher Probability Ratings than Low fear participants. However, Bets revealed far less consistent group differences, even when proximal to threat (Experiments 1 and 2), and differences between High and Low fear participants' Bets disappeared when they could not be anchored to previous Probability Ratings (Experiment 3). A Neutral Betting task also showed that general betting strategies were comparable between groups. We suggest that these findings may reflect the multi-representational nature of belief, in which both adaptive and maladaptive representations of a feared object may exist in parallel, with personal and contextual factors determining which form of representation is retrieved or expressed. This perspective can provide insights into the complex interplay of adaptive and maladaptive beliefs that is a central focus of currently dominant therapies.",39306831,specific phobia

Augmented Reality as an Aid to Behavior Therapy for Anxiety Disorders: A Narrative Review.,Rajkumar Ravi P,Cureus (2024),"Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders worldwide. These conditions are characterized by excessive anxiety that is difficult to control. In most anxiety disorders, symptoms are triggered by exposure to specific objects or situations. This leads sufferers to avoid such exposures, leading to impaired social and occupational functioning and reduced quality of life. Therapies based on behavioral principles, either alone or in combination with cognitive techniques, are the most effective psychological interventions for anxiety disorders. However, the effectiveness of these therapies may be limited due to a lack of generalization from clinic to real-world settings. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that provides an interactive experience by superimposing computer-generated content, often in multiple sensory modalities, on the real world. Emerging evidence suggests that AR may be useful in treating a broad range of mental disorders, including anxiety disorders. This review examines the evidence for the use of AR-based techniques as an aid to behavioral or cognitive-behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders. The available evidence suggests that this method may offer significant advantages over conventional therapies, particularly in the case of specific phobias, but also in social anxiety disorder. AR can also be combined with other novel technologies to monitor psychophysiological markers of anxiety and its reduction over the course of treatment. The advantages of AR could be related to its combination of real and simulated content, allowing for better generalization of the benefits of conventional exposure-based therapy. Though the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of this method need to be confirmed in larger samples, it could lead to a paradigm shift in the way behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders are conceptualized and delivered.",39282478,specific phobia

How should coronaphobia Be conceptualized? Evaluating competing models of the COVID-19 Phobia Scale using confirmatory factor analysis.,Lac Andrew,Journal of psychiatric research (2024),"Coronaphobia represents the fears and phobias attributed to the COVID-19 virus and pandemic. The COVID-19 Phobia Scale, previously validated as a four-factor structure, is a widely used multidimensional measure to assess coronaphobia. The current study scrutinized various competing factor structures of this instrument to identify the optimal psychometric representation of coronaphobia. Adults (N = 412) ranging in age from 19 to 84 years completed the COVID-19 Phobia Scale. Several theoretically plausible factor structures of coronaphobia were tested and compared using confirmatory factor analysis: four-factor structure, one-factor structure, higher-order factor structure, and five-factor bifactor structure. The one-factor structure showing an overarching factor of COVID-19 phobia revealed the poorest fit to the data. The five-factor bifactor structure that allowed every item to double-load on the COVID-19 general phobia factor alongside one of the COVID-19 specific phobia factors (psychological phobia, psycho-somatic phobia, economic phobia, or social phobia) produced the strongest fit indices and was superior to the widely accepted four-factor structure. The five-factor bifactor structure demonstrated multi-group measurement invariance across gender, race, age, and state urbanization. Furthermore, the general phobia factor and the psycho-somatic phobia factor from the five-factor bifactor structure uniquely predicted present moment state anxiety using structural equation modeling. This psychometric investigation underscores that coronaphobia is experienced as a general pandemic fear that is simultaneously experienced with specific domains of pandemic fears. Theoretical and methodological insights are offered for conceptualizing and measuring coronaphobia and understanding how pandemic phobias differ from traditional phobias.",39141996,specific phobia

Contamination in Trypophobia: investigating the role of disgust.,"Hain Simone, Stevenson Richard J",Cognition & emotion (2025),"Trypophobia is a relatively common aversion to clusters of holes. There is no consensus yet on which emotions are involved in Trypophobia nor in its functional utility. This report investigates the role of disgust using contamination tasks in two studies, which contrast people with an aversion to trypophobic stimuli to those without. In Study 1, participants reported their emotional reactions to imagined contamination of trypophobic images. In Study 2, participants evaluated physically present trypophobic, disgust, fear, and control stimuli. The capacity of these stimuli to contaminate other objects was established using a chain of contagion task. Across both studies, contamination was present, however, only those with an aversion to trypophobic stimuli evidenced contamination on the chain of contagion task, a hallmark of disgust responding. Elevated levels were not only reported for disgust, but also alongside fear/anxiety. Participant reports suggest an underlying disease avoidance mechanism in Trypophobia, with trypophobic participants demonstrating an exaggerated response to such stimuli involving disgust and fear/anxiety, which is also seen in small animal phobia, BII, and C-OCD. Implications, particularly for treatment are discussed.",39120561,specific phobia

"Interventions to reduce adult state anxiety, dental trait anxiety, and dental phobia: A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.","Steenen Serge A, Linke Fabiënne, van Westrhenen Roos, de Jongh Ad",Journal of anxiety disorders (2024),"This review evaluates randomized controlled trials (RCTs) intervening on adult state anxiety (fear and emotional distress during dental treatment), chronic dental (trait) anxiety or dental phobia (disproportionately high trait anxiety; meeting diagnostic criteria for specific phobia). Seven online databases were systematically searched. 173 RCTs met inclusion criteria, of which 67 qualified for 14 pooled analyses. To alleviate state anxiety during oral surgery, moderate-certainty evidence supports employing hypnosis (SMD=-0.31, 95 %CI[-0.56,-0.05]), and low-certainty evidence supports prescribing benzodiazepines (SMD=-0.43, [-0.74,-0.12]). Evidence for reducing state anxiety is inconclusive regarding psychotherapy, and does not support virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), virtual reality distraction, music, aromatherapy, video information and acupuncture. To reduce trait anxiety, moderate-certainty evidence supports using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; SMD=-0.65, [-1.06, -0.24]). Regarding dental phobia, evidence with low-to-moderate certainty supports employing psychotherapy (SMD=-0.48, [-0.72,-0.24]), and CBT specifically (SMD=-0.43, [-0.68,-0.17]), but not VRET. These results show that dental anxieties are manageable and treatable. Clinicians should ensure that interventions match their purpose-managing acute emotions during treatment, or alleviating chronic anxiety and avoidance tendencies.

Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Treating Fear of Contamination Disorders: A Systematic Review of Healthy and Clinical Populations.,"Ferraioli Francesca, Culicetto Laura, Cecchetti Luca, Falzone Alessandra, Tomaiuolo Francesco et al.",Brain sciences (2024),"Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), particularly immersive Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (iVRET), has gained attraction as an innovative approach in exposure therapy (ET), notably for some anxiety disorders with a fear of contamination component, such as spider phobia (SP) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This systematic work investigates iVRET's effectiveness in modulating disgust emotion-a shared aberrant feature across these disorders. Recent reviews have evaluated VRET's efficacy against in vivo ET. However, emerging evidence also highlights iVRET's potential in diminishing atypical disgust and related avoidance behaviors, expanding beyond traditional fear-focused outcomes. Our systematic synthesis, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, aims to fill this gap by assessing iVRET's efficacy in regulating disgust emotion within both clinical and at-risk populations, identified through standardized questionnaires and subjective disgust ratings. This research analyzes data from eight studies on clinical populations and five on healthy populations, offering an insight into iVRET's potential to mitigate the aberrant disgust response, a common transdiagnostic feature in varied psychopathologies. The findings support iVRET's clinical relevance in disgust management, providing evidence for a broader therapeutic application of iVRET and pointing out the need for more focused and complete investigations in this emergent field.",38790488,specific phobia
Absolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies for eight mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Cuijpers Pim, Miguel Clara, Ciharova Marketa, Harrer Mathias, Basic Djordje et al.",World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) (2024),"Psychotherapies are first-line treatments for most mental disorders, but their absolute outcomes (i.e., response and remission rates) are not well studied, despite the relevance of such information for health care users, providers and policy makers. We aimed to examine absolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies across eight mental disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD). We used a series of living systematic reviews included in the Metapsy initiative (www.metapsy.org), with a common strategy for literature search, inclusion of studies and extraction of data, and a common format for the analyses. Literature search was conducted in major bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials) up to January 1, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials comparing psychotherapies for any of the eight mental disorders, established by a diagnostic interview, with a control group (waitlist, care-as-usual, or pill placebo). We conducted random-effects model pairwise meta-analyses. The main outcome was the absolute rate of response (at least 50% symptom reduction between baseline and post-test) in the treatment and control conditions. Secondary outcomes included the relative risk (RR) of response, and the number needed to treat (NNT). Random-effects meta-analyses of the included 441 trials (33,881 patients) indicated modest response rates for psychotherapies: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.39-0.45) for MDD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33-0.43) for PTSD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30-0.47) for OCD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33-0.43) for panic disorder; 0.36 (95% CI: 0.30-0.42) for GAD; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.29-0.37) for social anxiety disorder; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.23-0.42) for specific phobia; and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.15-0.36) for BPD. Most sensitivity analyses broadly supported these findings. The RRs were significant for all disorders, except BPD. Our conclusion is that most psychotherapies for the eight mental disorders are effective compared with control conditions, but absolute response rates are modest. More effective treatments and interventions for those not responding to a first-line treatment are needed.",38727072,specific phobia
Development and initial validation of an open-access online Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) for spider fear.,"Grill Markus, Heller Martin, Haberkamp Anke",Psychological assessment (2024),"The behavioral avoidance test (BAT) is a well-known diagnostic tool assessing fear by directly measuring avoidance behavior. For instance, in spider phobia, participants or patients gradually approach a live spider until they feel too uncomfortable to continue. However, the use of different BAT protocols in various studies hampers the comparability of results. Moreover, conducting the test requires considerable preparation by researchers and clinicians. Thus, we have developed an open-access online BAT (vBATon). We validated its efficacy in measuring avoidance behavior and eliciting feelings of anxiety and disgust by comparing it to a real-life BAT (rl-BAT). Spider-fearful (N = 31) and nonfearful (N = 31) individuals completed a rl-BAT and vBATon on two separate dates within a 1-week interval. As expected, both tests successfully distinguished between spider-fearful and nonfearful individuals. Crucially, equivalence tests confirmed that vBATon captures avoidance behavior, anxiety, and disgust equal to the rl-BAT. Assessing validity, we found moderate to high correlations between vBATon and (a) the rl-BAT and (b) self-report measurements of spider fear (Spider Phobia Questionnaire, Fear of Spiders Questionnaire). Overall, our study displayed initial evidence of validity of vBATon and suggests that it is a standardized, efficient, and user-friendly alternative to rl-BATs for measuring spider fear. It can be utilized in both research and clinical practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).",38695790,specific phobia

Summer camps may provide an effective treatment avenue for youth who might not otherwise have access to care. This study describes the design and implementation of Fear Facers, a semistructured, 5-day, daytime exposure-therapy-based summer camp designed for youth with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety, separation anxiety, or a specific phobia. Preliminary data regarding feasibility and patient outcomes is also reported. Among 52 children and adolescents aged 7 to 16 who attended one of six camp sessions between 2018 and 2021, significant reductions in anxiety (d = 0.54) and OCD symptoms (d = 0.57) were observed from pre-camp to immediately post-camp. A subset of campers who were followed for an additional 3 months post-camp (n = 22) showed maintenance of treatment gains. Retention rates for the intervention were high. Our investigation provides further support for the use of a camp-based design for cognitive-behavioral approaches, and may provide a unique setting to maximize elements of inhibitory learning in exposures. We also discuss a number of elements regarding feasibility that need consideration for those hoping to develop similar interventions.",38670667,specific phobia

Association between resting-state connectivity patterns in the defensive system network and treatment response in spider phobia-a replication approach.,"Leehr Elisabeth J, Seeger Fabian R, Böhnlein Joscha, Gathmann Bettina, Straube Thomas et al.",Translational psychiatry (2024),"Although highly effective on average, exposure-based treatments do not work equally well for all patients with anxiety disorders. The identification of pre-treatment response-predicting patient characteristics may enable patient stratification. Preliminary research highlights the relevance of inhibitory fronto-limbic networks as such. We aimed to identify pre-treatment neural signatures differing between exposure treatment responders and non-responders in spider phobia and to validate results through rigorous replication. Data of a bi-centric intervention study comprised clinical phenotyping and pre-treatment resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data of n = 79 patients with spider phobia (discovery sample) and n = 69 patients (replication sample). RsFC data analyses were accomplished using the Matlab-based CONN-toolbox with harmonized analyses protocols at both sites. Treatment response was defined by a reduction of >30% symptom severity from pre- to post-treatment (Spider Phobia Questionnaire Score, primary outcome). Secondary outcome was defined by a reduction of >50% in a Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT). Mean within-session fear reduction functioned as a process measure for exposure. Compared to non-responders and pre-treatment, results in the discovery sample seemed to indicate that responders exhibited stronger negative connectivity between frontal and limbic structures and were characterized by heightened connectivity between the amygdala and ventral visual pathway regions. Patients exhibiting high within-session fear reduction showed stronger excitatory connectivity within the prefrontal cortex than patients with low within-session fear reduction. Whereas these results could be replicated by another team using the same data (cross-team replication), cross-site replication of the discovery sample findings in the independent replication sample was unsuccessful. Results seem to support negative fronto-limbic connectivity as promising ingredient to enhance response rates in specific phobia but lack sufficient replication. Further research is needed to obtain a valid basis for clinical decision-making and the development of individually tailored treatment options. Notably, future studies should regularly include replication approaches in their protocols.",38453896,specific phobia

However, studies targeting Dental Phobia (DP) yielded quite heterogeneous results and research concerning the effects of exposure treatments on phobic brain activation so far is missing. This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study aimed to investigate activation patterns in DP patients during exposure to phobia-related stimuli and the effects of an exposure-based fear treatment on phobia-related activation. Seventeen patients with DP and seventeen non-phobic, healthy controls participated in this fMRI experiment presenting dental-related and neutral auditory and visual stimuli. After completing a short exposure-based CBT program, patients were scanned a second time to illustrate treatment-related changes in brain activation patterns. Pre-treatment fMRI results demonstrate enhanced activation in DP-patients mainly in the precuneus and lateral parietal cortex. Moreover, a small activation focus was observed in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as parts of classically fear-related structures. Activation in all these clusters decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment assessment and in the case of the ACC was correlated with dental fear reduction. Activation changes in the precuneus and lateral parietal cortex suggest a pronounced first-person perspective memory processing including a vivid recall of contextual information from an egocentric perspective triggered by exposure to phobia-related stimuli. Besides a treatment-sensitive hyperactivity of fear-sensitive structures, DP may also be characterized by a disturbed memory retrieval that can be reorganized by successful exposure treatment.",38424282,specific phobia

Sie zählt zu den spezifischen Phobien. Die Emetophobie ist eine bisher noch wenig erforschte Erkrankung. Über Ursachen und Prävalenz ist nur wenig bekannt, zudem fehlt es an systematisch gesichertem Wissen zur Behandlung. Die meisten Studien weisen jedoch darauf hin, dass die Emetophobie überwiegend Frauen betrifft, früh in der Kindheit beginnt, meist einen chronischen Verlauf nimmt, mit psychischen Komorbiditäten einhergeht und Betroffene oft aus Scham nicht von ihrem Leiden berichten.

Wir berichten über den Fall einer 20-jährigen Frau, die initial wegen einer schweren depressiven Episode zur stationär-psychiatrischen Krankenhausbehandlung aufgenommen wurde. Das Erkennen der Emetophobie war dadurch erschwert, dass die Patientin aus Scham nicht spontan über ihre Symptome berichtete. Eine gründliche und strukturierte Anamneseerhebung ist daher unerlässlich, da Betroffene oft versuchen, ihre Symptome zu verheimlichen. Aus diesem Grunde wird die Erkrankung oft übersehen und meist erst spät diagnostiziert und behandelt.

Efficacy of tDCS to enhance virtual reality exposure therapy response in acrophobia: A randomized controlled trial.,"Hui Hui, Hong Ang, Gao Jian, Yu Jiejing, Wang Zhen",Journal of psychiatric research (2024),"[BACKGROUND]: Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been recognized as an effective treatment for specific phobias and has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional exposure therapy. The pursuit of non-invasive brain stimulation provides a practical means of augmenting VRET. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, stimulates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with the potential to enhance the effects of exposure therapy. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine whether tDCS enhanced the effects of VRET in acrophobia. [METHOD]: This study recruited 64 college students with significant fear of height (based on the Acrophobia Questionnaire, AQ). Finally, 61 participants were randomly allocated to the tDCS active-stimulated group (n = 30) or the sham-stimulated group (n = 31). After stimulation, VRET was conducted, and clinical indices were recorded. The AQ was used as the first primary outcome, and Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) and the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ) were used as secondary outcomes. [RESULT]: There was a significant reduction in psychometric and behavioral anxiety measurements from pre to post treatment as indicated by main effects for the factor time (AQ-Anxiety: F (2.60) = 139.55, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.83; AQ-Avoidance: F (2.60) = 53.73, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.69; HIQ: F (2.60) = 128.12, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.81; STAI-Y-S: F (2.60) = 15.44, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.34; BAI: F (2.60) = 73.81, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.71). Compared with the sham-stimulated group, the reduction of AQ-Anxiety and SUDS in the first exposure trial (F (2,60) = 8.56, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.23; t = 2.34, p = 0.024, d = 0.61) was significantly faster in the active group. At follow-up, there was also a further reduction in AQ anxiety and avoidance (Anxiety: M = 56.51 ± 27.19; main effect time F (1,60) = 25.16, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.35; Avoidance: M = 12.57 ± 7.97; main effect time F (1,60) = 31.40, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.45) without interaction time*group (Anxiety: F (1.60) = 0.12, p = 0.740, η2 = 0.00; Avoidance: F (1.60) = 0.64, p = 0.430, η2 = 0.02). [CONCLUSION]: Results could be explained tDCS could accelerate the effects of VRET on acrophobia by stimulating mPFC, indicating that tDCS may be used as an enhancement technique for exposure therapy for specific phobias.",38244333,specific phobia

Assessing Fear of Thyroid Cancer in the General U.S. Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Taylor Stephanie R, Chiu Alexander, Hoxha Ines, Saucke Megan C, Jensen Catherine B et al.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association (2024),"Background: This study aimed to measure fear of thyroid cancer in the general U.S. population and identify factors associated with a high level of thyroid cancer-specific fear that may contribute to overtreatment. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using Prolific Academic Ltd.®, an online survey platform. The survey was administered in August 2020 to English speaking adults (>17 years) in the United States who were registered with Prolific. The target sample was stratified to represent the demographics of the U.S. population. A validated, eight-item breast cancer fear scale was adapted to measure thyroid cancer-specific fear. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors significantly associated with high levels of thyroid cancer-specific fear. Results: Of the 1136 respondents (94.3% eligibility), 50.4% were female, 74.1% White, and the mean age was 45 years (SD = 16 years). Overall, 47.5% of respondents had high levels of thyroid cancer-specific fear. Multivariate regression demonstrated that age <40 years (OR = 2.46 vs. 65+ [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.60-3.80]) and female gender (OR = 1.48 vs. male [CI = 1.13-1.93]) were associated with high levels of thyroid cancer fear. Believing thyroid cancer (OR = 2.71 [CI = 1.99-3.69]) and cancer in general are serious (OR = 1.53 [CI = 1.13-2.08]) were also associated with high levels of thyroid cancer fear. Respondents who overestimated thyroid cancer incidence (OR = 1.64 [CI = 1.25-2.13]) and believed they had a high chance of developing cancer (OR = 1.70 [CI = 1.19-2.42]) were also more likely to have high fear of thyroid cancer. Conclusion: Thyroid cancer-specific fear is prevalent in U.S. adults particularly in females and those younger than 40 years. Because disease-specific fear is associated with overtreatment, targeted education about the seriousness, incidence, and risk factors for developing thyroid cancer may decrease public fear and possibly overtreatment related to ""scared decision-making.""",38115606,specific phobia

"Psychological interventions to improve pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and quality of life in children and adults with hypermobility spectrum disorders and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a systematic review.","Clark Natalie L, Kainth Gurvinder Singh, Johnson Melissa, Rangan Amar, Kottam Lucksy et al.",Rheumatology international (2024),"Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) affect individuals across physical, psychological and social domains, making assessment and management difficult. Management for this condition primarily focuses on addressing the musculoskeletal complaints using physiotherapy rather than the additional manifestations such as fatigue, anxiety and depression. This systematic review aims to identify psychological interventions and assess whether they improve the lived experiences of individuals with HSD. It also aims to assess which psychological interventions were most effective, which symptoms were most effectively managed by a psychological intervention, and whether there were differences between children and adults. Studies were included if they were a randomised controlled trial or pre/post-test design, a sample of any age and clinical diagnosis of HSD (including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), used a psychological intervention and assessed the effect of the intervention on lived experiences using appropriate outcome measures. Risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The results were narratively synthesised. Six studies were included in the review, one isolated psychological intervention and five incorporated a psychological intervention within a multidisciplinary programme. The interventions predominantly aimed to reduce pain including intensity, interference, pain-related fear and catastrophising, with anxiety and depression, affect, daily living, fatigue also being evaluated. The most beneficial psychological interventions were those delivered alongside physiotherapy in an outpatient or community setting, improving both the physical and psychological aspects of pain, subsequently improving quality of life. However, there lacks randomised controlled trials with larger samples to definitively confirm the significant findings discussed in this review.",38091036,specific phobia
Cannabis use and social anxiety disorder in emerging adulthood: Results from a nationally representative sample.,"Single Alanna, Alcolado Gillian, Keough Matthew T, Mota Natalie",Journal of anxiety disorders (2024),"Cannabis use and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are prevalent during emerging adulthood. Previous work has demonstrated that SAD is related to cannabis use in adults; however, less is known about what correlates relate to this association in emerging adults. A subsample of individuals ages 18-25 years old from the NESARC-III (N = 5194) was used to (a) evaluate the association between cannabis use and SAD and (b) examine what correlates may be associated with cannabis use and SAD in emerging adulthood. Weighted cross-tabulations assessed sociodemographics and lifetime psychiatric disorder prevalence estimates among the emerging adult sample. Multinomial logistic regressions examined associations between sociodemographics and psychiatric disorders and four groups (i.e., no cannabis use or SAD; cannabis use only; SAD only; cannabis use + SAD). The prevalence of co-occurring cannabis use and SAD was 1.10%. Being White, a part-time student, or not a student were associated with increased odds of having co-occurring cannabis use + SAD (OR range: 2.26-3.09). Significant associations also emerged between major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder and co-occurring cannabis use + SAD (AOR range: 3.03-19.05). Results of this study may have implications for better identifying and screening emerging adults who are at risk of co-occurring cannabis use and SAD.",38061325,specific phobia
Immersive Virtual Reality Exposures for the Treatment of Childhood Anxiety.,"Ramsey Kesley A, Essoe Joey Ka-Yee, Boyle Nathan, Patrick Ainsley K, McGuire Joseph F",Child psychiatry and human development (2025),"Exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy and is recommended as a front-line treatment for childhood anxiety. Unfortunately, challenges exist that impact the effective implementation of exposure-based CBT in clinical practice. One of the primary challenges is the accessibility and availability of exposure stimuli (e.g., spiders, storms, heights) in CBT sessions. Immersive virtual reality (VR) has shown promise as a scalable and sustainable solution to address this clinical need, but remains largely untested in youth with anxiety disorders. Here, we examine the use of VR exposures in the treatment of youth with an anxiety disorder (i.e., specific phobias). We aimed to investigate: (1) the feasibility and clinical benefit of VR exposures; (2) whether VR exposures elicit changes in physiological arousal and/or subjective distress; and (3) whether habituation serves as a mechanism across physiological and subjective outcomes for VR exposures. Three youth and their parents completed a clinical evaluation, which was followed by a one session treatment (OST) with VR exposures. Afterward, youth and parents completed clinical assessments one-week and 1-month after treatment. Immersive VR exposures were found to be feasible and demonstrated clinical benefit for reducing anxiety severity. Additionally, VR exposures elicited changes in both physiological and subjective outcomes. Finally, physiological habituation to VR exposures was observed among participants who exhibited treatment response at follow-up. Collectively, these findings demonstrate preliminary evidence that VR exposures are feasible, tolerable, and show some therapeutic benefit for treating youth with anxiety.",37985621,specific phobia
