Abemaciclib impairs glioblastoma sphere formation by targeting the GSK3β-mediated transcriptional regulation of CD44 and TCF7L2.,"Liang Muh-Lii, Chen Chun-Han, Lin Ya-Ching, Lin Yu-Chen, Liu Yun-Ru et al.",Cancer gene therapy (2025),"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor partly driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Abemaciclib demonstrates the potential for treating GBM, although its mechanisms beyond RB phosphorylation are not fully understood. This study reveals that Abemaciclib diminishes GBM sphere formation by influencing EMT pathways via GSK3β-mediated regulation of CD44 and TCF7L2. Treatment with Abemaciclib significantly hindered sphere formation in GBM cells, and transcriptomic analysis indicated EMT pathways suppression. Mechanistically, Abemaciclib consistently lowered the expression of CD44 and TCF7L2 in both parental and sphere cells by inhibiting GSK3β phosphorylation. A pharmacological GSK3β inhibitor produced similar effects, reinforcing the existence of a GSK3β-CD44/TCF7L2 axis. Moreover, orthotopic xenografts confirmed reduced tumor growth and CD44 expression in vivo. Analyses of TCGA and CGGA datasets revealed that the mesenchymal GBM subtype (MES-GBM), linked with poor outcomes, exhibits elevated EMT gene expression. Treatment of MES-like LN229 cells with Abemaciclib resulted in decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β and reductions in EMT-related gene expression. Our findings highlight a novel EMT-suppressive action of Abemaciclib, illustrating its therapeutic potential for targeting the CSCs and for treating the MES-GBM. This research provides mechanistic insights and justification for repurposing Abemaciclib as targeted therapies for aggressive glioblastoma.",40813896,Medical Image Analysis
A novel approach in diagnosing knee osteoarthritis for content based image retrieval in big data analytics and medical images.,"Bozdag Pinar Gundogan, Mutlu Hurşit Burak, Karaduman Mucahit, Yildirim Muhammed, Khan M Attique et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"The rapid growth in database size due to technological advances has led to difficulties in locating and accessing specific data components. While deep learning and other machine learning architectures are promising in retrieving data components, their effectiveness is more pronounced when addressing groups of diseases. On the contrary, this effectiveness decreases when large data sets are accessed. Content-based Image retrieval (CBIR) methods are used in large data sets. In this study, knee osteoarthritis detection was performed using a developed hybrid CBIR-based system. Knee Osteoarthritis is the wear and tear of the cartilage in the knee joint. Knee osteoarthritis is a disease whose incidence increases, especially after a certain age. In this study, CBIR techniques were preferred to detect knee osteoarthritis. In the proposed method, feature extraction was performed using DarkNet53, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). These features are combined to leverage the benefits of different aspects of the same image. To enhance the proposed model's speed and effectiveness, a hybrid model was developed utilizing the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) method. Seven different distance measurement metrics were used in the developed CBIR model. Current deep learning architectures published in the literature struggle to achieve comparable success rates in distinguishing between closely related but distinct disease groups. The study highlights the challenges that increasing class diversity poses for the performance of deep learning architectures. In addition, the developed system aims to overcome the limitations of existing deep learning models in distinguishing similar disease groups.",40813877,Medical Image Analysis

RGB color correction and gamut limitations in smartphone-based kinetic analysis of chemical reactions.,"Fyfe Calum, Yu Shengkai, Zhang Jing, Reid Marc",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry (2025),"The variability in hardware specifications and environmental factors poses significant challenges to the use of smartphone cameras in analytical measurement. Towards time-resolved color analysis and reaction monitoring, we systematically quantified multiple sources of measurement uncertainty in smartphone-based color measurements, finding that while sensor repeatability is high ( Δ E < 0.5  ), lighting conditions and viewing angles can introduce substantial bias ( Δ E  versus reference colors increasing by up to 64% at oblique angles). We implemented and evaluated a matrix-based image color correction methodology using a color reference chart, reducing inter-device and lighting-dependent variations by 65-70% (quantified by the color change metric, Δ E  ). Moving beyond static image correction to video analysis, our approach was validated through the monitoring of Blue1 dye degradation kinetics using videos recorded on two different smartphones. Time-resolved and color-corrected measurements from both devices produced consistent kinetic profiles. Importantly, we identified a fundamental limitation in RGB-based colorimetry: highly saturated colors that exceed the sRGB color gamut create artificial discontinuities in kinetic profiles, manifesting as ""shouldering"" effects not present in spectrophotometric data. Unlike previous methods that focused on controlling environmental factors through custom enclosures, our time-resolved color correction methodology systematically quantifies and corrects for multiple sources of color bias across various smartphone models, enabling standardized measurements even in variable conditions. This advancement enhances the reliability of field-ready, smartphone-based colorimetric applications and establishes a framework for calibrating video-based reaction monitoring against established spectroscopic measurements.",40813462,Medical Image Analysis
Clinical Validation of Deep Learning for Image Restoration of Ultra-Low-Count [18F]FDG PET for Dementia Diagnostics.,"Schiller Florian, Brumberg Joachim, Frings Lars, Deschamps Joran, Schmied Christopher et al.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine (2025)","Deep learning (DL) represents a promising technique for image restoration. We explored its ability to restore ultra-low-count [18F]FDG PET studies of the brain in subjects with dementia and in healthy subjects to allow for reduced scan durations or administered activities without compromising diagnostic performance. Methods: Various DL models using the content aware image restoration approach of CSBDeep toolbox (3D U-nets) were trained with subvolumes of 1,000 random subjects. On the basis of 10-min list-mode PET data after injection of 208 ± 10 MBq of [18F]FDG, we reconstructed reduced scan durations of 2 min, 1 min, 30 s, 20 s, and 10 s. The resulting models were applied to [18F]FDG PET scans of subjects with Alzheimer disease (n = 15), frontotemporal dementia (n = 14), and healthy controls (n = 13). We explored the effect of reduced scan times on individual regional measures in diagnostically relevant regions and on voxel-based group contrasts. Three independent readers rated all datasets with regard to assessability, diagnosis, and diagnostic confidence. Results: Individual mean regional [18F]FDG uptake remained largely unchanged. The SD strongly increased with shorter scan duration without application of DL (mean increase ≤ 48%), whereas it slightly decreased with DL (≥-7%). In group contrasts, the number of significant voxels strongly decreased with shorter scan time without DL (≥-41%), which was partially offset by DL (≥-27%). On visual reads, the fraction of assessable images steeply fell to only 4% (10-s scan) for scan durations below 2 min without DL, whereas every single image restored with DL was assessable. The diagnostic confidence continuously declined with shorter scan durations without DL, whereas diagnostic confidence only negligibly changed with DL (intermediate-to-high confidence ratings: 0%-54% vs. 80%-84%; 83% for the 10-min scan). The diagnostic accuracy of PET reads dropped from 90% to 4% without and remained high with DL (90%-93%; 90% for the 10-min scan). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the compelling performance of DL to restore cerebral [18F]FDG PET datasets with ultra-low-count statistics for quantitative regional, voxel-based group, and clinical visual analyses. Consequently, DL enables a dramatic reduction of scan durations or administered activities (e.g., 10-min scan with 3.5 MBq, equivalent to ∼60 µSv) for [18F]FDG PET in patients with dementia and possibly other indications.",40813236,Medical Image Analysis

Advanced Feature Extraction and Outlier Detection for 3D Biological/Biomedical Image Registration.,"Hamzehei Sahand, Bai Jun, Raimondi Gianna, Tripp Rebecca, Ostroff Linnaea et al.",IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics (2025),"3D image registration is essential in computer vision, medical imaging, and robotics. By aligning images from different perspectives into a single coordinate system, this approach provides a consistent viewpoint for analysis. Using accurate image alignment, we may compare, evaluate, and integrate data from different contexts. This paper describes a new method to register 3D or z-stack microscopy and medical image. It uses a hybrid of traditional and deep learning methods for feature extraction and adaptive likelihood-based methods for finding outliers. The proposed method uses the Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and the Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50) to extract effective features to obtain precise and accurate representations of image contents. The registration approach also relies on the adaptive Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple Consensus (MLESAC) method, which optimizes outlier detection and increases noise and distortion resistance to improve the efficacy of these combined extracted features. This concatenation approach demonstrates robustness, flexibility, and adaptability across a variety of imaging modalities, enabling the registration of complex images with higher precision. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms commonly used registration methods, including SIFT, KAZE, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB), and also registration software tools such as bUnwarpJ, and TurboReg. The algorithm's effectiveness is evaluated in terms of Mutual Information (MI), Phase Congruency-Based (PCB), and Gradient-Based Metrics (GBM). These metrics are applied to two types of datasets, including a brain scan dataset and 3D serial sections of multiplex microscopy image datasets.",40811303,Medical Image Analysis
Lung-DDPM: Semantic Layout-guided Diffusion Models for Thoracic CT Image Synthesis.,"Jiang Yifan, Lemarechal Yannick, Bafaro Josee, Abi-Rjeile Jessica, Joubert Philippe et al.",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering (2025),"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4×, 3.1×, and 29.5× better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a Dice Coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8% and 18.6% improvements in Dice and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.

Head-to-Head Comparison between MRI and CT in the Evaluation of Volume and Quality of Epicardial Adipose Tissue.,"Firouznia Marjan, Molnar David, Edin Carl, Hjelmgren Ola, Östgren Carl-Johan et al.",Radiology. Cardiothoracic imaging (2025),"Purpose To systematically compare MRI- and CT-based measurements of both the volume and quality of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT). Materials and Methods This prospective study included participants from a subset of the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) who underwent MRI and CT between November 2017 and July 2018. Dixon fat-water separation MR images were manually segmented, and a threshold-based approach based on a fat signal fraction (FSF) map was used to obtain the EAT volume. Within this EAT volume, the mean FSF was quantified as a measure of fat quality. EAT segmentation from CT images was performed using deep learning techniques, and the EAT volume and its mean attenuation were quantified. Correlation between MRI- and CT-based measurements of EAT volume and quality was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Ninety-two participants (mean age, 59 years ± 5 [SD]; 60 male participants) were included. The intermodality correlation for EAT volume was very strong (r = 0.92, P < .001), with systematically larger values for CT versus MRI (P < .001). There was a strong negative correlation between MRI FSF and CT attenuation (r = -0.72, P < .001). Repeatability analysis for assessment of MRI EAT volume showed good interreader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.86) and excellent intrareader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.96). Conclusion Correlation between MRI and CT was very strong for EAT volume and strong for EAT quality.

Early Diagnosis of Knee Osteoarthritis With a Natural Language Processing-Driven Approach Based on Clinician Notes: Development and Validation Study.,"Thanyakunsajja Narathip, Jitkajornwanich Kulsawasd, Xu Shan, Shin Donghee, Charoenporn Pattama",JMIR formative research (2025),"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common form of knee arthritis that can cause significant disability and affect a patient's quality of life. Although this disease is chronic and irreversible, the patient's condition can be improved and the progression of the disease can be prevented if the disease is diagnosed early and the patient receives appropriate treatment immediately. Therefore, the prediction of knee OA is considered one of the essential steps to effectively diagnose and prevent further severe OA conditions. Knee OA is commonly diagnosed by medical experts or physicians, and the diagnosis of OA is mainly based on patients' laboratory results and medical images, including x-ray and magnetic resonance images. However, diagnosis through such data is often time-consuming. Moreover, the diagnosis results can vary among physicians depending on their expertise. Previous studies mostly focused on using approaches, such as those involving artificial intelligence, to automatically detect knee OA through such data. However, these studies did not incorporate clinicians' or doctors' notes (text data) into the analysis, although these data involving reported symptoms and behaviors are already available and easier to collect and access than laboratory data and image data.",40810448,Medical Image Analysis

Surgical Innovations in Otolaryngology: A Critical Analysis of Emerging Techniques and Technologies.,"Naqvi Bushra, Ameen Samreen, Batool Syeda Wajiha, Riaz Maryum, Umer Muhammad Rizwan et al.",Cureus (2025),"Introduction An evaluation of new methods of surgery in otolaryngology is done with emphasis on four advanced surgical techniques: transoral robotic surgery (TORS), image-guided sinus surgery (IGSS), endoscopic skull base surgery, and 3D-printed implant-assisted procedures. The study evaluated a sample of 300 patients from Pakistan, ensuring that the evaluation was done in the light of these technologies vis-à-vis traditional ones. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of such surgical innovations in terms of quality of life (QoL), complication rates, follow-up compliance, and intra-operative parameters. In addition, this study aimed to identify predictors for postoperative complications, thereby profiling potential selection biases for using these advanced techniques in surgical interventions. Methodology A retrospective cohort analysis of 300 patients was conducted, including demographic variables, clinical events, tumor volumes, and comorbidities according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index and frailty scores. Assessment of postoperative outcome parameters included QoL, complication events, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. A random forest model was trained to predict postoperative complications and showed an accuracy of 86.7% with an AUC-ROC of 0.91. Results The TORS and 3D-printed implant groups performed much better, showing significantly higher QoL scores (84.3 and 82.5 on average), low complication rates (9.7% and 6.8%), and high follow-up compliance (87% and 84%). They also show less blood loss and less time in ICUs. However, far fewer comorbidities and smaller tumors were found in these patients, which points toward a selection bias. Conclusion Emerging surgical innovations in otolaryngology, such as TORS and 3D-printed implants, create remarkable benefits in clinical scenarios associated with QoL and complications.

Dual-Path Adversarial Denoising Network Based on UNet.,"Yu Jinchi, Zhou Yu, Sun Mingchen, Wang Dadong","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Digital image quality is crucial for reliable analysis in applications such as medical imaging, satellite remote sensing, and video surveillance. However, traditional denoising methods struggle to balance noise removal with detail preservation and lack adaptability to various types of noise. We propose a novel three-module architecture for image denoising, comprising a generator, a dual-path-UNet-based denoiser, and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic noise patterns to augment training data, while the dual-path-UNet denoiser uses multiple receptive field modules to preserve fine details and dense feature fusion to maintain global structural integrity. The discriminator provides adversarial feedback to enhance denoising performance. This dual-path adversarial training mechanism addresses the limitations of traditional methods by simultaneously capturing both local details and global structures. Experiments on the SIDD, DND, and PolyU datasets demonstrate superior performance. We compare our architecture with the latest state-of-the-art GAN variants through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. These results confirm the effectiveness of noise removal with minimal loss of critical image details.

Highly Accelerated Dual-Pose Medical Image Registration via Improved Differential Evolution.,"Zhou Dibin, Xing Fengyuan, Liu Wenhao, Liu Fuchang","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Medical image registration is an indispensable preprocessing step to align medical images to a common coordinate system before in-depth analysis. The registration precision is critical to the following analysis. In addition to representative image features, the initial pose settings and multiple poses in images will significantly affect the registration precision, which is largely neglected in state-of-the-art works. To address this, the paper proposes a dual-pose medical image registration algorithm based on improved differential evolution. More specifically, the proposed algorithm defines a composite similarity measurement based on contour points and utilizes this measurement to calculate the similarity between frontal-lateral positional DRR (Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph) images and X-ray images. In order to ensure the accuracy of the registration algorithm in particular dimensions, the algorithm implements a dual-pose registration strategy. A PDE (Phased Differential Evolution) algorithm is proposed for iterative optimization, enhancing the optimization algorithm's ability to globally search in low-dimensional space, aiding in the discovery of global optimal solutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate similarity metrics compared to conventional registration algorithms; the dual-pose registration strategy largely reduces errors in specific dimensions, resulting in reductions of 67.04% and 71.84%, respectively, in rotation and translation errors. Additionally, the algorithm is more suitable for clinical applications due to its lower complexity.",40807770,Medical Image Analysis

The proposed method is trained and evaluated on segmentation datasets including the Montgomery County Dataset (MC) and Shenzhen Hospital Dataset (SH), and classification datasets such as Chest X-Ray Images for Pneumonia (CXIP) and COVIDx. Compared with seven segmentation models (U-Net, Attention-Net, SegNet, FPNNet, DANet, DMNet, and SETR), five classification models (ResNet34, ResNet50, DenseNet121, Swin-Transforms, and ShuffleNetV2), and state-of-the-art methods, our PCSNet model achieved high segmentation performance on CXR images. Compared to the state-of-the-art Attention-Net model, the accuracy of PCSNet increased by 0.19% (98.94% vs. 98.75%), and the boundary accuracy improved by 0.3% (97.86% vs. 97.56%), while requiring 62% fewer parameters. For pneumonia classification using the CXIP dataset, the proposed strategy outperforms the current best model by 0.14% in accuracy (98.55% vs. 98.41%). For COVID-19 classification with the COVIDx dataset, the model reached an accuracy of 97.50%, the absolute improvement in accuracy compared to CovXNet was 0.1%, and clinical metrics demonstrate more significant gains: specificity increased from 94.7% to 99.5%. These results highlight the model's effectiveness in medical image analysis, demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.",40807746,Medical Image Analysis
Improving Endodontic Radiograph Interpretation with TV-CLAHE for Enhanced Root Canal Detection.,"Obuchowicz Barbara, Zarzecka Joanna, Strzelecki Michał, Jakubowska Marzena, Obuchowicz Rafał et al.",Journal of clinical medicine (2025),"Objective: The accurate visualization of root canal systems on periapical radiographs is critical for successful endodontic treatment. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of several image enhancement algorithms-including a novel Total Variation-Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (TV-CLAHE) technique-in improving the detectability of root canal configurations in mandibular incisors, using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) as the gold standard. A null hypothesis was tested, assuming that enhancement methods would not significantly improve root canal detection compared to original radiographs. Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 periapical radiographs of mandibular incisors, resulting in 420 images after applying seven enhancement techniques: Histogram Equalization (HE), Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), CLAHE optimized with Pelican Optimization Algorithm (CLAHE-POA), Global CLAHE (G-CLAHE), k-Caputo Fractional Differential Operator (KCFDO), and the proposed TV-CLAHE. Four experienced observers (two radiologists and two dentists) independently assessed root canal visibility. Subjective evaluation was performed using an own scale inspired by a 5-point Likert scale, and the detection accuracy was compared to the CBCT findings. Quantitative metrics including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), image entropy, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) were calculated to objectively assess image quality. Results: Root canal detection accuracy improved across all enhancement methods, with the proposed TV-CLAHE algorithm achieving the highest performance (93-98% accuracy), closely approaching CBCT-level visualization. G-CLAHE also showed substantial improvement (up to 92%). Statistical analysis confirmed significant inter-method differences (p < 0.001). TV-CLAHE outperformed all other techniques in subjective quality ratings and yielded superior SNR and entropy values. Conclusions: Advanced image enhancement methods, particularly TV-CLAHE, significantly improve root canal visibility in 2D radiographs and offer a practical, low-cost alternative to CBCT in routine dental diagnostics. These findings support the integration of optimized contrast enhancement techniques into endodontic imaging workflows to reduce the risk of missed canals and improve treatment outcomes.",40807175,Medical Image Analysis
Added Value of SPECT/CT in Radio-Guided Occult Localization (ROLL) of Non-Palpable Pulmonary Nodules Treated with Uniportal Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy.,"Aricò Demetrio, Motta Lucia, Giacoppo Giulia, Bambaci Michelangelo, Macrì Paolo et al.",Journal of clinical medicine (2025),"Background/Objectives: The extensive use of computed tomography (CT) has led to a significant increase in the detection of small and non-palpable pulmonary nodules, necessitating the use of invasive methods for definitive diagnosis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become the preferred procedure for nodule resections; however, intraoperative localization remains challenging, especially for deep or subsolid lesions. This study explores whether SPECT/CT improves the technical and clinical outcomes of radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL) before uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (u-VATS). Methods: This is a retrospective study involving consecutive patients referred for the resection of pulmonary nodules who underwent CT-guided ROLL followed by u-VATS between September 2017 and December 2024. From January 2023, SPECT/CT was systematically added after planar imaging. The cohort was divided into a planar group and a planar + SPECT/CT group. The inclusion criteria involved nodules sized ≤ 2 cm, with ground glass or solid characteristics, located at a depth of <6 cm from the pleural surface. 99mTc-MAA injected activity, timing, the classification of planar and SPECT/CT image findings (focal uptake, multisite with focal uptake, multisite without focal uptake), spillage, and post-procedure complications were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed, with continuous data expressed as the median and categorical data as the number. Comparisons were made using chi-square tests for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for procedural duration. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated to assess agreement between imaging modalities. Results: In total, 125 patients were selected for CT-guided radiotracer injection followed by uniportal-VATS. The planar group and planar + SPECT/CT group comprised 60 and 65 patients, respectively. Focal uptake was detected in 68 (54%), multisite with focal uptake in 46 (36.8%), and multisite without focal uptake in 11 patients (8.8%). In comparative analyses between planar and SPECT/CT imaging in 65 patients, 91% exhibited focal uptake, revealing significant differences in classification for 40% of the patients. SPECT/CT corrected the classification of 23 patients initially categorized as multisite with focal uptake to focal uptake, improving localization accuracy. The mean procedure duration was 39 min with SPECT/CT. Pneumothorax was more frequently detected with SPECT/CT (43% vs. 1.6%). The intraoperative localization success rate was 96%. Conclusions: SPECT/CT imaging in the ROLL procedure for detecting pulmonary nodules before u-VATs demonstrates a significant advantage in reclassifying radiotracer positioning compared to planar imaging. Considering its limited impact on surgical success rates and additional procedural time, SPECT/CT should be reserved for technically challenging cases. Larger sample sizes, multicentric and prospective randomized studies, and formal cost-utility analyses are warranted.",40806959,Medical Image Analysis

Automated Segmentation and Morphometric Analysis of Thioflavin-S-Stained Amyloid Deposits in Alzheimer's Disease Brains and Age-Matched Controls Using Weakly Supervised Deep Learning.,"Barczánfalvi Gábor, Nyári Tibor, Tolnai József, Tiszlavicz László, Gulyás Balázs et al.",International journal of molecular sciences (2025),"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, whose quantification plays a central role in understanding disease progression. Automated segmentation of Aβ deposits in histopathological micrographs enables large-scale analyses but is hindered by the high cost of detailed pixel-level annotations. Weakly supervised learning offers a promising alternative by leveraging coarse or indirect labels to reduce the annotation burden. We evaluated a weakly supervised approach to segment and analyze thioflavin-S-positive parenchymal amyloid pathology in AD and age-matched brains. Our pipeline integrates three key components, each designed to operate under weak supervision. First, robust preprocessing (including retrospective multi-image illumination correction and gradient-based background estimation) was applied to enhance image fidelity and support training, as models rely more on image features. Second, class activation maps (CAMs), generated by a compact deep classifier SqueezeNet, were used to identify, and coarsely localize amyloid-rich parenchymal regions from patch-wise image labels, serving as spatial priors for subsequent refinement without requiring dense pixel-level annotations. Third, a patch-based convolutional neural network, U-Net, was trained on synthetic data generated from micrographs based on CAM-derived pseudo-labels via an extensive object-level augmentation strategy, enabling refined whole-image semantic segmentation and generalization across diverse spatial configurations. To ensure robustness and unbiased evaluation, we assessed the segmentation performance of the entire framework using patient-wise group k-fold cross-validation, explicitly modeling generalization across unseen individuals, critical in clinical scenarios. Despite relying on weak labels, the integrated pipeline achieved strong segmentation performance with an average Dice similarity coefficient (≈0.763) and Jaccard index (≈0.639), widely accepted metrics for assessing segmentation quality in medical image analysis. The resulting segmentations were also visually coherent, demonstrating that weakly supervised segmentation is a viable alternative in histopathology, where acquiring dense annotations is prohibitively labor-intensive and time-consuming. Subsequent morphometric analyses on automatically segmented Aβ deposits revealed size-, structural complexity-, and global geometry-related differences across brain regions and cognitive status. These findings confirm that deposit architecture exhibits region-specific patterns and reflects underlying neurodegenerative processes, thereby highlighting the biological relevance and practical applicability of the proposed image-processing pipeline for morphometric analysis.",40806269,Medical Image Analysis

"Recurrence Patterns, Treatment Outcomes, and Prognostic Factors of Thymic Carcinoma: A Multicenter Study.","Tomita Natsuo, Ishihara Shunichi, Nomoto Yoshihito, Takada Akinori, Nakamura Katsumasa et al.",Cancers (2025),"Objectives: This multicenter study aimed to clarify the recurrence patterns; treatment outcomes; and prognostic factors of thymic carcinoma, a rare cancer. Methods: We analyzed 101 patients with thymic carcinoma who underwent multidisciplinary treatment, including radiotherapy. The median age was 62 years, with 27 patients in stage I-II; 44 in stage III; and 30 in stage IV by the TNM classification. Seventy-two patients underwent surgery with radiotherapy; and 29 patients underwent definitive radiotherapy. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and elective nodal irradiation (ENI) were used for 35 and 23 patients, respectively. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS); progression-free survival (PFS); and overall survival (OS) were calculated, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: With a median follow-up of 68 months, we observed 17 local recurrences; 27 regional recurrences; and 35 distant metastases. The 5-year LRFS; PFS; and OS were 82%, 41%, and 76%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that stage was the only factor associated with LRFS; PFS; and OS (p = 0.040; p < 0.0001; and p = 0.048, respectively), while treatment modality was associated with only LRFS (p = 0.015). IGRT and ENI were also associated with LRFS (p = 0.002 and 0.013, respectively). PFS and OS of stage IV patients were comparable between the surgery with radiotherapy and definitive radiotherapy groups (p = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of stage-specific treatment strategies rather than resectability, especially for stage IV patients. These results should be validated in a prospective study. Our results also suggest that radiotherapy methods influence recurrence.",40805209,Medical Image Analysis
Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Focused Data Augmentation Methods in Rib Fracture Detection in CT Images.,"Göktekin Mehmet Çağrı, Gül Evrim, Aksu Feyza, Gül Yeliz, Özen Metehan et al.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Background/Objectives: Rib fracture detection holds critical importance in the field of medical image processing. Methods: In this study, two different data augmentation methods, traditional data augmentation (Albumentations) and focused data augmentation (focused augmentation), were compared using computed tomography (CT) images for the detection of rib fractures on YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv8m models. While the traditional data augmentation method applies general transformations to the entire image, the focused data augmentation method performs specific transformations by targeting only the fracture regions. Results: The model performance was evaluated using the Precision, Recall, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 metrics. The findings revealed that the focused data augmentation method achieved superior performance in certain metrics. Specifically, analysis on the YOLOv8s model showed that the focused data augmentation method increased the mAP@50 value by 2.18%, reaching 0.9412, and improved the recall value for fracture detection by 5.70%, reaching 0.8766. On the other hand, the traditional data augmentation method achieved better results in overall precision metrics with the YOLOv8m model and provided a slight advantage in the mAP@50 value.

Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Orthognathic Surgery Need in Skeletal Class II Patients Using Facial Profile Images: An Artificial Intelligence Study.,"Tahmasbi Soodeh, Shokoofi Hadi, Dalaie Kazem, Behnaz Mohammad, Aghdashi Farzad et al.",Journal of imaging informatics in medicine (2025),"Orthognathic surgery is often required to address moderate to severe skeletal class II malocclusion, a condition that affects both facial aesthetics and function. Traditional diagnosis relies on cephalometric radiographs and expert evaluation, which can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. The need for AI-assisted initial screening based exclusively on lateral soft tissue profiles is increasingly recognized, particularly for identifying mandibular retrusion relative to the maxilla. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based model for classifying lateral facial profile photographs into surgical (S) and non-surgical (NS) categories. A dataset of 524 standardized profile images from skeletal class II patients was collected from three dental centers. Each image was independently reviewed by a panel of five experts (three orthodontists and two maxillofacial surgeons), with labels assigned based on majority consensus. To minimize visual bias and enhance model performance, images underwent preprocessing involving facial cropping, background removal via U2-Net segmentation, silhouette contour extraction, and resizing to 128 × 128 pixels. A custom convolutional neural network (ContourNet) was developed and optimized using fivefold cross-validation. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 90%, with a precision of 92% for NS and 88% for S, and a recall of 88% for NS and 92% for S. Saliency maps revealed that the model focused on clinically relevant regions, particularly the lower jaw and chin in surgical cases. This deep learning framework demonstrates strong potential as a non-invasive, efficient tool for preliminary screening in orthognathic surgery decision-making. Further external validation on larger and more diverse populations is recommended prior to clinical implementation.",40804594,Medical Image Analysis

Comparative analysis of AI support levels in clinical interpretation of traumatic pelvic radiographs.,"Tee Yu-San, Huang Jen-Fu, Huang Yu-Ting, Hsu Chi-Po, Chen Huan-Wu et al.",NPJ digital medicine (2025),"Plain pelvic radiographs (PXR) remain crucial for initial trauma assessment, yet interpretation challenges persist. While artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise, its practical impact across specialties remains unexplored. We conducted a retrospective image-based, multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study using a standardized, prospectively planned evaluation protocol. A total of 26 physicians (8 radiologists, 10 emergency physicians, 8 trauma surgeons) interpreted 150 PXRs in three sequential sessions: without AI, with AI-alert, and with AI-visual guidance. AI assistance improved overall diagnostic accuracy from 0.870 to 0.940 (p < 0.001) and reduced interpretation time from 22.70 to 9.58 s (p < 0.001). Non-radiologists showed substantial improvements, with emergency physicians demonstrating increases in specificity (26.2%, p = 0.006) and positive predictive value (41.5%, p = 0.006). Trauma surgeons with AI-visual guidance achieved comparable accuracy to unaided radiologists (0.940 vs. 0.920, p = 0.556). Tailored AI assistance effectively bridges the performance gap between radiologists and non-radiologists while reducing reading time.

A novel brain MRI classification framework integrating tuned single scale retinex and empirical wavelet entropy features.,"Kumar Paravathanani Rajendra, Prakash Krishna, Teja Buraga Ram Sai, Manoj Kota Akhil, Bhuvaneswar Adi et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"Brain tumors are caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which are often irregular in shape. Growing at such a rate of about 1.4% per day, the abnormal rate of growth accounts for an invisible illness and depressive behavioral changes; hence, brain tumors have become a major cause of increased death rates among adults worldwide. The prognosis of a brain tumor can be improved significantly if the tumor is diagnosed early using different imaging modalities. Out of these various imaging systems, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most commonly used diagnostic modality because it is non-invasive and provides clear visualization of brain tissues. This study proposes a novel brain MRI image classification framework involving image enhancement, adaptive decomposition, statistical feature extraction, and a supervised classification method. First, the contrast of magnetic resonance is improved through the Tuned Single-Scale Retinex (TSSR) technique. Afterward, these enhanced images are decomposed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) so that informative subbands can be extracted. From each subband, energy and entropy features (Shannon and Tsallis) are computed and concatenated into a feature vector. This feature set is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) and LPBoost classifiers. The model was evaluated on a binary-class brain MRI dataset comprising 280 images sourced from the Harvard Medical School and Kaggle repositories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.43%, with a true positive rate (TPR) of 100% and a true negative rate (TNR) of 77.78%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The primary contributions include the introduction of EWT-based statistical features for brain MRI classification and the use of TSSR for enhanced image quality, offering a robust and generalizable solution for medical image analysis.",40804243,Medical Image Analysis

These images were analyzed through deep neural networks to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial infections based on visual features and symptoms. The dataset is the largest publicly available dataset in this field, which includes images from 742 patients experiencing common cold symptoms. For each patient, it also records the presence or absence of 20 symptoms, age, gender, and between 4 to 9 diagnoses by different physicians.

In vivo variability of MRI radiomics features in prostate lesions assessed by a test-retest study with repositioning.,"Zhang Kevin Sun, Neelsen Christian Jan Oliver, Wennmann Markus, Hielscher Thomas, Kovacs Balint et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"Despite academic success, radiomics-based machine learning algorithms have not reached clinical practice, partially due to limited repeatability/reproducibility. To address this issue, this work aims to identify a stable subset of radiomics features in prostate MRI for radiomics modelling. A prospective study was conducted in 43 patients who received a clinical MRI examination and a research exam with repetition of T2-weighted and two different diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with repositioning in between. Radiomics feature (RF) extraction was performed from MRI segmentations accounting for intra-rater and inter-rater effects, and three different image normalization methods were compared. Stability of RFs was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for different comparisons: rater effects, inter-scan (before and after repositioning) and inter-sequence (between the two diffusion-weighted sequences) variability. In total, only 64 out of 321 (~ 20%) extracted features demonstrated stability, defined as CCC ≥ 0.75 in all settings (5 high-b value, 7 ADC- and 52 T2-derived features). For DWI, primarily intensity-based features proved stable with no shape feature passing the CCC threshold. T2-weighted images possessed the largest number of stable features with multiple shape (7), intensity-based (7) and texture features (28).

DMP-Net: Deep semantic prior compressed spectral reconstruction method towards intraoperative imaging of brain tissue.,"Cao Chipeng, Li Jie, Wang Pan, Qi Chun",Medical image analysis (2025),"In the diagnosis and surgical resection of brain tumors, hyperspectral imaging, as a non-invasive detection technology, can effectively characterize the morphological structure and the physicochemical differences in cellular metabolism of different tissues. However, live tissues typically exhibit certain motion characteristics, and traditional hyperspectral imaging systems struggle to meet the demands for real-time and rapid imaging. The snapshot compressive spectral imaging (CSI) system can quickly acquire spatial spectral information of the lesion area in a single exposure and, combined with reconstruction algorithms, effectively restore the high-dimensional spectral information of brain tissue. High-quality reconstruction results are crucial for ensuring the reliability of spectral analysis of brain tissue. To improve the reconstruction performance of the CSI system, this paper proposes a compressive spectral reconstruction method based on deep semantic prior regularization. The predicted results of the deep convolutional prior model are used as the initial spectral estimate to establish a regularization term for the reconstruction process. This is combined with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize the solution for high-dimensional spectral images of brain tissue. The results show that using the CSI system for intraoperative brain tissue imaging can rapidly acquire spatial spectral information of the lesion area. By optimizing the reconstruction process with the deep convolutional prior model, this method not only better preserves the structural consistency of spectral images from different patients but also fully considers the spectral differences of different types of brain tumors, achieving higher reconstruction quality. This provides strong support for the precise localization and resection of brain tumors.

MoACNN-XGNet: Interpretable Multi-Omics Convolutional Network for Breast Cancer Subtyping and Prognostic Genes Identification.,"Li Qian, Liu Lei, Zhang Qing, Zhang Xiaobin, Li Na et al.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics (2025),"Breast cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease at both the phenotypic and molecular levels, presents significant challenges for prognosis and treatment. Accurate subtyping of breast cancer is critical due to its complex biological characteristics, which directly influence disease progression and therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we integrate multi-omics data, including copy number variation, RNA sequencing and DNA methylation, to generate two-dimensional representations of each sample using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. This transformation enhances data interpretability and supports subsequent learning tasks. Traditional convolutional neural networks have demonstrated potential in medical image analysis but often struggle with high-dimensional omics data. To address this limitation, we propose MoACNN-XGNet, an attention-based convolutional neural network framework that prioritizes key features within image-transformed multi-omics data. Our method significantly improves the precision of subtype classification and effectively overcomes the challenges posed by the high dimensionality and structural complexity of multi-omics data. Furthermore, we employ the Guided Grad-CAM method to enhance model interpretability, enabling the identification of subtype-specific explainable genes. Subsequent enrichment and survival analyses of these genes reveal critical biological pathways and potential therapeutic targets. This study offers a novel approach to refining breast cancer subtyping and highlights the potential for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately aiming to improve patient survival outcomes.",40802631,Medical Image Analysis
Brain compensation and volume alterations in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis: a cross-sectional neuroimaging study.,"Chaim Fuad F, Imamura Marta, Chaim-Avancini Tiffany M, Leite Claudia C, Squarzoni Paula et al.",Rheumatology international (2025),"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease worldwide and the leading cause of functional disability. Recent studies have shown alterations in gray matter (GM) volume in areas related to pain sensitivity and perception in patients experiencing chronic pain. These brain changes may be reversible once pain relief is obtained. This study aimed to compare brain volume measurements in patients with chronic pain due to knee OA with healthy controls using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. Additionally, we aimed to correlate these findings with motor functional capacity and stiffness data. We selected 29 adults with severe knee OA and 28 healthy controls, matched for age and gender. All participants underwent MRI, and the images were processed and analyzed using the VBM method with the SPM 8 program. Predefined brain areas, including the insula, prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral cortex, ventrolateral cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus, were selected for comparative analysis. We observed a reduction in GM volume in patients with knee OA pain compared to healthy controls in several regions, including the right and left anterior cingulate gyrus, right amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, left amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, right precuneus, and right insula. Additionally, we observed an increase in GM volume in the right and left orbitofrontal cortex and right superior temporal cortex. Our results support the hypothesis that knee OA-related pain is associated with region-specific volumetric brain alterations. Importantly, the observed increases in orbitofrontal and temporal GM volume may reflect compensatory neuroplasticity in response to chronic pain burden. These findings align with emerging models of brain compensation. Understanding these patterns may facilitate the development of prognostic and surrogate biomarkers for chronic pain and inform brain-targeted rehabilitation strategies.",40802103,Medical Image Analysis

Smartphone-Powered Pdot Biosensors for Quantitative Phenylketonuria Screening at the Point of Care.,"Zeng Zirui, Dai Yanchun, Deng Sile, Liu Zihao, Feng Ruixin et al.",Advanced healthcare materials (2025),"Current clinical management of hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria (PKU) lacks accessible, real-time diagnostic tools. To address this gap, a portable biosensing system integrating semiconducting polymer dot (Pdot) technology with miniaturized optics for rapid phenylalanine quantification is developed. The biosensor leverages phenylalanine dehydrogenase to enzymatically convert phenylalanine into NADH, enabling ratiometric fluorescence detection through electron transfer-mediated quenching of Pdots by NADH. This mechanism achieves exceptional sensitivity in human plasma, with a limit of detection (0.29 µm) surpassing conventional methods, alongside robust photostability. To ensure clinical practicality, the platform incorporates a 3D-printed, light-isolated housing and a compact optical module, enhancing field-deployable durability. A dedicated smartphone application facilitates real-time image capture and chromatic analysis, translating fluorescence signals into quantitative phenylalanine levels via a calibrated B/R ratio algorithm. Validation studies demonstrated linear correlation across the pathophysiological range (0-2400 µm), outperforming existing assays in accuracy and inter-device consistency. By merging biochemical specificity with engineered hardware, this innovation bridges laboratory-grade precision with point-of-care usability, providing a scalable solution for early diagnosis and personalized management of PKU and related metabolic disorders.",40801112,Medical Image Analysis
Functional brain mapping using whole-head very high-density diffuse optical tomography.,"Fogarty Morgan, Rafferty Sean M, Markow Zachary E, O'Sullivan Anthony C, Svoboda Calamity F et al.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2025)","Naturalistic neuroimaging tasks, such as watching movies, are becoming increasingly popular due to being more engaging than resting-state paradigms and more ecologically valid than isolated block-design tasks. As these tasks push the boundaries of naturalistic paradigms, the need for an equally naturalistic imaging device increases. Optical imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a wearable, non-invasive neuroimaging approach. Advancements in high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) use a dense array of optical elements to provide overlapping multi-distance fNIRS light measurements for fidelity comparable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, to further improve image quality, we increased the density of the imaging grid to 9.75 mm, first nearest neighbor spacing between sources and detectors, leading to a 4-fold increase in measurement density. This very high-density DOT (VHD-DOT) system uses 255 sources and 252 detectors to improve image quality while expanding the field of view. From simulations, the increased density led to improved image resolution across multiple metrics compared with HD-DOT. In vivo group-averaged functional localizer maps are in strong agreement with those collected in MRI on the same cohort of adult participants, indicating that VHD-DOT can be used as a surrogate for fMRI in task-based studies. For a naturalistic movie-viewing task, feature regressor analysis was employed to map audiovisual features from the clip, which also revealed excellent agreement between VHD-DOT and fMRI. Template-based decoding of task and movie-viewing data demonstrates that VHD-DOT signals are repeatable and discriminable, which is necessary for more advanced naturalistic task analyses. This work builds upon previously reported HD-DOT designs to improve the image quality and resolution for whole-head optical imaging. This system is promising for future studies using complex stimuli and analysis protocols, such as decoding, and future work developing wireless VHD-DOT systems.",40800993,Medical Image Analysis
Localizing hierarchical prediction errors and precisions during an oddball task with volatility: Computational insights and relationship with psychosocial functioning in healthy individuals.,"Charlton Colleen E, Hauke Daniel J, Wobmann Michelle, de Bock Renate, Andreou Christina et al.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2025)","The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been widely used to investigate deficits in early auditory information processing, particularly in psychosis. Predictive coding theories suggest that impairments in sensory learning may arise from disturbances in hierarchical message passing, likely due to aberrant precision-weighting of prediction errors (PEs). This study employed a modified auditory oddball paradigm with varying phases of stability and volatility to disentangle the impact of hierarchical PEs on auditory MMN generation in 43 healthy controls (HCs). Single-trial EEG data were modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian model of learning to identify neural correlates of low-level PEs about tones and high-level PEs about environmental volatility. Our analysis revealed a reduced expression of the auditory MMN in volatile compared to stable phases of the paradigm. Additionally, lower Global Functioning (GF): Social scores were associated with a reduced difference waveform at 332 ms after stimulus presentation across the entire MMN paradigm. Further analysis revealed that this association was present during the volatile phase but not the stable phase of the paradigm. Source reconstruction suggested that the association between the stable difference waveform and psychosocial functioning originated in the left superior temporal gyrus. Finally, we found significant EEG signatures of both low- and high-level PEs and precision ratios. Our findings highlight the value of computational models in understanding the neural mechanisms involved in early auditory information processing and their connection to psychosocial functioning.",40800881,Medical Image Analysis
The effects of musicality on brain network topology in the context of Alzheimer's disease and memory decline.,"Matziorinis Anna Maria, Leemans Alexander, Skouras Stavros, Flo Birthe Kristin, Bashevkin Tobias et al.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024)","Music's role in modulating brain structure, particularly in neurodegenerative contexts such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), has been increasingly recognized. While previous studies have hinted at the potential neuroplastic benefits of musical engagement and training, the mechanisms through which music impacts structural connectivity in neurodegenerative pathways remain underexplored. We aimed to examine the impact of music perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity in areas relating to memory, emotion, and learning in individuals with worsening memory impairment, investigating the potential neuroplastic effects of music. Employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based structural connectivity and graph theoretical analysis, we investigated brain topological features in 78 participants aged 42 to 85 with a range of memory impairments. Participants were assessed for musical training, engagement, and perception skills. The study analyzed regional and local network topological metrics to examine the influence of musical activities on graph metrics, while controlling for stages of objective memory impairment (SOMI) and diagnosis, separately. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of musical perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity within memory, emotion, and learning-related brain areas in individuals with varying degrees of memory impairment. We found enhanced structural connectivity of the right hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate cortex was associated with stronger local network metrics, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, with increased music perception skills like melody and beat perception. Musical training specifically impacted the clustering coefficient of the right hippocampus and the node degree of the right mid cingulate gyrus. Active musical engagement influenced the eigenvector centrality of the right hippocampus. Furthermore, musical training was associated with enhanced global metrics, such as global efficiency and characteristic path length. Our study integrates diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and graph theoretical analysis to reveal significant effects of musical activities on structural connectivity in key brain regions. The results highlight the potential of musical activities to serve as a non-invasive modulatory tool for cognitive resilience, especially in memory impairment and neurodegeneration contexts. These insights contribute to the understanding of delaying AD onset and aiding early-stage patients through music-based interventions, emphasizing the importance of musical engagement in maintaining cognitive and brain health.",40800535,Medical Image Analysis
Self-supervised representation learning for nerve fiber distribution patterns in 3D-PLI.,"Oberstrass Alexander, Muenzing Sascha E A, Niu Meiqi, Palomero-Gallagher Nicola, Schiffer Christian et al.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024)","A comprehensive understanding of the organizational principles in the human brain requires, among other factors, well-quantifiable descriptors of nerve fiber architecture. Three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) is a microscopic imaging technique that enables insights into the fine-grained organization of myelinated nerve fibers with high resolution. Descriptors characterizing the fiber architecture observed in 3D-PLI would enable downstream analysis tasks such as multimodal correlation studies, clustering, and mapping. However, best practices for observer-independent characterization of fiber architecture in 3D-PLI are not yet available. To this end, we propose the application of a fully data-driven approach to characterize nerve fiber architecture in 3D-PLI images using self-supervised representation learning. We introduce a3D-Context Contrastive Learning(CL-3D) objective that utilizes the spatial neighborhood of texture examples across histological brain sections of a 3D reconstructed volume to sample positive pairs for contrastive learning. We combine this sampling strategy with specifically designed image augmentations to gain robustness to typical variations in 3D-PLI parameter maps. The approach is demonstrated for the 3D reconstructed occipital lobe of a vervet monkey brain. We show that extracted features are highly sensitive to different configurations of nerve fibers, yet robust to variations between consecutive brain sections arising from histological processing. We demonstrate their practical applicability for retrieving clusters of homogeneous fiber architecture, performing classification with minimal annotations and query-based retrieval of characteristic components of fiber architecture such as U-fibers.",40800494,Medical Image Analysis
Isoflurane titration improves detection of hippocampal lactate by 1 H-MRS.,"Frame Ariel K, Khazaee Reza, Courchesne Marc, Wilson Scott K, Bellyou Miranda et al.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024)","Lactate has increasingly been recognized as both an important fuel source and a signaling molecule within the brain. Alterations in brain lactate levels are associated with various neurological diseases. Thus, there is great interest in thein vivodetection and measurement of cerebral lactate levels in animals used for investigation of normal brain function and models of disease. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive technique used to measure lactate and other metabolites within the brain. However, lactate can be difficult to detect with conventional1H-MRS due to its low abundance and spectral overlap with lipids. In addition, volatile anesthetics used during image acquisition increase lactate production, potentially masking any subtle physiological changes in lactate levels. Here, we made use of a transgenic mouse model in which expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha), the rate-limiting enzyme of lactate production, was induced within cortical and hippocampal neurons. Unexpectedly,1H-MRS analysis, under typical isoflurane-induced anesthesia of 4% induction followed by 1.6-2% maintenance, revealed no significant elevation of hippocampal lactate levels in neuronalLdhainduction mice compared to control mice. In contrast,1H-MRS analysis, using an isoflurane titration protocol in which mice were sequentially exposed to 1.6%, 2%, and then finally 3% isoflurane, revealed significantly higher hippocampal lactate levels inLdhatransgenic mice compared to controls. In addition, significantly fewer mice were required to detect differences in lactate levels using the isoflurane titration protocol compared to conventional isoflurane-induced anesthesia. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling for the effects of anesthesia when detecting changes in hippocampal lactate levelsin vivoand offer a novel protocol for enhanced cerebral lactate detection.",40800453,Medical Image Analysis
Cortical alterations associated with executive function deficits in youth with a congenital heart defect.,"Abboud Fatme, Easson Kaitlyn, Ehrler Melanie, Ziolkowski Justine, Rohlicek Charles V et al.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024)","Adolescents and young adults born with a complex congenital heart defect (CHD) are at risk for executive function (ExF) impairments, which contribute to the psychological and everyday burden of CHD. Cortical dysmaturation has been well described in fetuses and neonates with CHD and early evidence suggests that cortical alterations in thickness, surface area, and gyrification index are non-transient and can be observed in adolescents with CHD. However, cortical alterations have yet to be correlated with ExF deficits in youth with CHD. This study aims to use a data-driven approach to identify the most important cortical features associated with ExF deficits in adolescents and young adults with CHD. To do so, we combined two comparable datasets acquired at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and the University Children's Hospital Zurich, each including both youth with CHD and healthy controls. For each participant, a high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance image, a self-reported ExF assessment (the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Scale), and their clinical and demographic characteristics were available. Corticometric Iterative Vertex-Based Estimation of Thickness (CIVET) was used to extract cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and local gyrification index measures. Using orthogonal projective non-negative matrix factorization (OPNMF), we identified non-overlapping spatial components that integrate cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and local gyrification index and capture structural covariance across these features. Behavioral partial least squares correlation (bPLS) analysis was then used to compute correlations between the individual variability in the OPNMF covariance patterns and ExF outcomes for each subject. A total of 56 youth with CHD who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery before 3 years of age and 56 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in our analyses. Cortical grey matter volume, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area were found to be significantly reduced in CHD patients compared to controls. OPNMF identified 12 stable cortex-wide components summarizing the inter-subject variability in cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and local gyrification index. bPLS revealed two significant latent variables (LV) accounting for a total of 82.8% of the variance in the sample, each describing distinct patterns between the brain and cognitive data. LV1 summarized a pattern of belonging to the CHD group, worse scores on most Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Scale (BRIEF-A) scales, younger age at MRI, and female sex. This pattern was associated with increased cortical thickness, local gyrification index, and decreased cortical surface area in several OPNMF components. Finally, we identified a positive relationship between the LV1 brain-behavior pattern and total aortic cross-clamp time in the CHD group, indicating that longer aortic cross-clamp time was associated with worse neuropsychological outcomes. In this study, we uncover novel multivariate relationships between ExF and alterations in cortical thickness, surface area, and local gyrification index in adolescents and young adults with CHD using a data-driven approach. Although our findings highlight the important role played by the cortex in higher-order cognitive processes, future studies are needed to elucidate the individual contribution of individual and clinical attributes into the deficits observed in this population.",40800383,Medical Image Analysis

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4o in interpreting radiological imaging, specifically X-ray, CT, and MRI images, across various organ systems and disease types. Methods A total of 377 cases were collected and presented to GPT-4o with a standardized prompt and no clinical context. The responses were assessed by three independent raters using a five-point rating system. Results X-ray imaging exhibited a 2.21 times higher chance, on average, of being interpreted accurately compared to CT scans (odds ratio (OR): 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33 - 3.69), while pelvic imaging had a 6.25 times lower chance, on average, of being interpreted accurately when compared to images of the abdomen (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.56). Additionally, neoplastic conditions had a 2.7 times lower chance, on average, of being interpreted accurately compared to bleeding conditions (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.84). Conclusion A bimodal distribution of median ratings highlights an overreliance on comparability to prior image encounters and emphasizes the need to develop a systematic approach to image analysis. Future research should prioritize eliminating hallucination, establishing standardized evaluation criteria, and exploring methods to integrate visual and text-based data in a balanced manner.

An imaging genetics network model for clinical score assessment in Alzheimer's disease.,"Sheng Jinhua, Xin Yu, Zhang Qiao, Wang Luyun, Wang Binbing",PNAS nexus (2025),"Imaging genomics has recently emerged as a prominent focus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, showing great potential in predicting and diagnosing. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream imaging genetics network (DS-IGN) approach to AD clinical score assessment. DS-IGN is composed of two branches: one processes longitudinal data (neuroimaging) and the other handles static data (gene information). The imaging branch leverages hypergraphs to capture high-order relationships, constructing hypergraphs for samples and image features and performing weighted fusion. The genetic branch introduces an attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the weights of different genetic loci, which is particularly effective when multiple genes interact. By integrating both imaging and genetic features, DS-IGN effectively predicts patients' clinical scores in advance, providing early warnings of cognitive decline and supporting timely interventions to slow disease progression.",40799348,Medical Image Analysis
Limited predictive value of pretreatment P-glycoprotein immunostaining for chemotherapy efficacy and survival in long-follow-up osteosarcoma patients.,"Higuchi Takashi, Igarashi Kentaro, Miwa Shinji, Takeuchi Akihiko, Hayashi Katsuhiro et al.",Medicine (2025),"The clinical utility of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in osteosarcoma remains controversial. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the association between P-gp expression and clinicopathological factors, chemotherapy (CTx) response, and prognosis in osteosarcoma. Twenty-three osteosarcoma patients treated at our institution between 2007 and 2013 were included. P-gp expression rate was measured by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis. CTx response was evaluated by image evaluation (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria) and pathological evaluation (Rosen and Huvos classification). The association between P-gp expression rate and clinicopathological factors, CTx response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) was statistically analyzed. The P-gp expression rates ranged from 1.7% to 67.9% (mean 46.0%). No significant association was found between P-gp expression rate and surgical stage, CTx response, or clinical outcome. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an optimal P-gp cutoff value of 47.0% for predicting poor CTx response, with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 67%. When patients were divided into P-gp positive (n = 13) and negative (n = 10) groups based on the 47.0% cutoff value, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of surgical stage, CTx response, OS, and DFS. Although the P-gp positive group showed a trend towards worse OS and DFS, no statistically significant differences were observed (OS: P = .73, DFS: P = .32). P-gp expression in osteosarcoma was not significantly associated with surgical stage, CTx response, or prognosis. These findings suggest that P-gp may not be a useful biomarker for CTx selection or prognosis prediction in osteosarcoma.",40797473,Medical Image Analysis

These repeat homology arms promote frame-retentive cassette integration and reduce deletions both at the target site and within the transgene. We demonstrate precise integrations at 32 loci in HEK293T cells. Germline-transmissible transgene integration and endogenous protein tagging in Xenopus and adult mouse brains demonstrated precise integration during early embryonic cleavage and in nondividing, differentiated cells. Optimized repair arms also facilitated small edits for scarless single-nucleotide or double-nucleotide changes using oligonucleotide templates in vitro and in vivo.

Glymphatic system dysfunction correlated with gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.,"Wu Hui, Liu Bingdong, Liu Weiyin Vivian, Wen Zhi, Yang Wenbing et al.","Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany) (2025)","Structural and functional brain abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ) are well-documented, yet the role of the glymphatic system remains largely unexplored. Given emerging evidence linking the microbiome-gut-brain axis to SZ, this study aims to investigate the glymphatic system function in SZ patients using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) and to explore its associations with gut microbiota and cognitive performance. Multi-omics data were obtained from a cohort of 87 SZ patients and 70 healthy controls (HCs), including fecal 16S rRNA sequencing, DTI-ALPS index analysis, and cognitive assessments. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships among the gut microbiome, DTI-ALPS index, and cognitive performance. Compared to HCs, patients with SZ exhibited significantly lower DTI-ALPS indices in the left, right, and bilateral hemispheres. These indices were positively associated with multiple cognitive domains. In addition, gut microbial dysbiosis was observed in SZ, characterized by a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in pathogenic bacteria. Exploratory analyses further revealed a tripartite link among the key microbial genera, DTI-ALPS indices, and cognitive performance. Notably, the higher abundance of Proteus as well as the lower abundance of Blautia and Faecalibacterium may contribute to poorer cognitive performance, potentially through disruptions in the right DTI-ALPS index. These findings provide novel insights into glymphatic dysfunction in SZ and highlight a potential microbiota-glymphatic-cognition pathway contributing to cognitive impairments.",40796779,Medical Image Analysis
A non-sub-sampled shearlet transform-based deep learning sub band enhancement and fusion method for multi-modal images.,"Sengan Sudhakar, Gugulothu Praveen, Alroobaea Roobaea, Webber Julian L, Mehbodniya Abolfazl et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"Multi-Modal Medical Image Fusion (MMMIF) has become increasingly important in clinical applications, as it enables the integration of complementary information from different imaging modalities to support more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The primary objective of Medical Image Fusion (MIF) is to generate a fused image that retains the most informative features from the Source Images (SI), thereby enhancing the reliability of clinical decision-making systems. However, due to inherent limitations in individual imaging modalities-such as poor spatial resolution in functional images or low contrast in anatomical scans-fused images can suffer from information degradation or distortion. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel fusion framework that integrates the Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for effective sub-band enhancement and image reconstruction. Initially, each source image is decomposed into Low-Frequency Coefficients (LFC) and multiple High-Frequency Coefficients (HFC) using NSST. The proposed Concurrent Denoising and Enhancement Network (CDEN) is then applied to these sub-bands to suppress noise and enhance critical structural details. The enhanced LFCs are fused using an AlexNet-based activity-level fusion model, while the enhanced HFCs are combined using a Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) guided by a Novel Sum-Modified Laplacian (NSML) metric. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed via Inverse-NSST (I-NSST). Experimental results prove that the proposed method outperforms existing fusion algorithms, achieving approximately 16.5% higher performance in terms of the QAB/F (edge preservation) metric, along with strong results across both subjective visual assessments and objective quality indices.",40796770,Medical Image Analysis
Singletrome enhances detection of long noncoding RNAs in single cell transcriptomes.,"Rahman Raza Ur, Ahmad Iftikhar, Li Zixiu, Sparks Robert P, Ben Saad Amel et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of gene expression in individual cell types, but scRNA-seq studies have focused primarily on expression of protein-coding genes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are more diverse than protein-coding genes, yet remain underexplored in part because they are underrepresented in reference annotations applied to scRNA-seq. Merging annotations containing protein-coding and lncRNA genes is not sufficient, because the addition of lncRNA genes that overlap in sense and antisense with protein-coding genes will affect how reads are counted for both protein-coding and lncRNA genes. Here, we introduce Singletrome, a Singularity image that integrates protein-coding and lncRNA gene transfer format (GTF) annotations to generate enhanced annotations that take into account the sense and antisense overlap of annotated genes, maps scRNA-seq data, and produces files for downstream analysis and visualization. With Singletrome, we detected thousands of lncRNAs not included in GENCODE, clustered cell types based solely on lncRNA expression, and demonstrated that machine learning can predict cell type and disease through lncRNAs alone. This comprehensive annotation will allow mapping of lncRNA expression across cell types of the human body, facilitating the development of an atlas of human lncRNAs in health and disease with the ability to integrate new lncRNA annotations as they become available.",40796606,Medical Image Analysis

AI presents a potential breakthrough in real-time, objective and rapid endoscopic assessment, with implications for predicting disease progression. It is anticipated that, by harmonising multimodal data, AI will transform patient care through early diagnosis, accurate patient profiling and therapeutic response prediction. The ability of AI in cross-sectional medical imaging to improve diagnostic accuracy, automate and enable objective assessment of disease activity and predict clinical outcomes highlights its transformative potential. AI models have consistently outperformed traditional methods of image interpretation, particularly in complex areas such as differentiating IBD subtypes, identifying disease progression and complications. The use of AI in histology is a particularly dynamic research field. Implementation of AI algorithms in clinical practice is still lagging, a major hurdle being the lack of a digital workflow in many pathology institutes. Adoption is likely to start with implementation of automatic disease activity scoring. Beyond matching pathologist performance, algorithms may teach us more about IBD pathophysiology. While AI is set to substantially advance IBD diagnostics, various challenges such as heterogeneous datasets, retrospective designs and assessment of different endpoints must be addressed. Implementation of novel standards of reporting may drive an increase in research quality and overcome these obstacles.",40796218,Medical Image Analysis

It tackles challenges in open long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT 2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45 disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a manually annotated ""gold standard"" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases.

Comparison of rectal and bladder dose between retractor insertion and gauze packing in intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer.,"Osaki Noriko, Soyano Takashi, Sutani Shinya, Matsumoto Hideki, Takeda Atsuya et al.",Journal of radiation research (2025),"This study aimed to compare and verify the rectal and bladder doses of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) using both rectal retractor (RR) and gauze packing (GP) in the same patients. A total of 37 patients who underwent ICBT using RR and GP for cervical cancer were included in this study. Rectal and bladder dose and volume data were compared with the RR and GP treatments in the same patients and the confounding factors were examined. When comparing RR and GP, the median and interquartile ranges for rectal D2cc were 2.8 (2.5-3.7) Gy with RR and 3.2 (2.7-3.8) Gy with GP. The median bladder D2cc was 4.9 (4.5-6.3) Gy with RR and 4.8 (3.9-5.4) Gy with GP. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that rectal doses were significantly lower with RR (P = 0.02), whereas bladder doses were significantly higher with RR (P < 0.001). Analysis of the correlation between the number of gauze pieces and the difference in rectal D2cc between GP and RR using Pearson's distribution revealed no significant correlation (R = -0.20, P = 0.22), as well as bladder D2cc between GP and RR also revealed no significant correlation (R = -0.20, P = 0.22). The number of gauze pieces did not necessarily correlate with a reduction in the rectal and bladder dose. In conclusion, rectal D2cc was lower with RR in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer, whereas bladder D2cc was higher with RR than with GP.",40794896,Medical Image Analysis

Design of on-chip coded X-ray sensors for high-confidence super-resolution radiological imaging.,"Mao Tianyi, Wang Lei, Jiang Yuqi, Ma Xu, Zhu Shujin et al.",Applied optics (2025),"Robustness and confidence are crucial in super-resolution tasks for X-ray radiological imaging, both in terms of X-ray sensors and image processing techniques. Due to the extremely short wavelengths of X-rays, optical modulation in X-ray imaging systems is highly challenging. Consequently, single-image super-resolution techniques in computer vision have become a popular approach in medical imaging. However, these methods can lead to artifacts and the plasticity phenomenon, potentially compromising image quality and diagnostic accuracy. In this manuscript, we introduce an on-chip coded aperture design that is both cost-effective and helps overcome the additional constraints and limitations commonly found in traditional computational-imaging-based super-resolution X-ray systems. This design generates sub-pixel physical coding on X-ray sensors, and thus a three-dimensional (3D) computational decoding approach is presented that transforms the two-dimensional (2D) super-resolution reconstruction into a 3D compressed sensing problem. Unlike super-resolution restoration in computer vision, this problem can be mathematically solved to yield interpretable reconstructions under the constraints of the restricted isometry property. Our experimental results, complemented by qualitative analysis, demonstrate the superiority of our design in X-ray radiological imaging, effectively mitigating artifacts and the ""plastic-like"" appearance frequently associated with conventional super-resolution techniques.",40793439,Medical Image Analysis
Head-mounted displays based on human eye condition variation patterns.,"Cao Tuo, Wang Lingyun, Yan Shenghu, Gong Shijie","Journal of the Optical Society of America. A, Optics, image science, and vision (2025)","In response to the practical demands for a wide field of view (FOV), long exit pupil distance, and high image quality in head-mounted displays, an initial structure was built based on the principles of catadioptric lenses in a folded optical path (pancake optics) and the field curvature correction formula. Subsequently, using even-order aspheric surfaces, a VR optical system was developed with a FOV of 2w=110∘, an exit pupil distance of 15 mm, and an exit pupil diameter of 8 mm. Compared to traditional designs, a human eye model was introduced as the image plane to construct a VR-human eye optical system analysis model, allowing for direct analysis of the retinal image quality under different states of the human eye. After that, based on medical statistical data, the impact of different light intensity conditions on the retinal image quality of the VR optical system was explored. Experimental results showed that changes in light intensity affect the pupil diameter, which, in turn, influences the final image quality of the system. To solve the issues, two solutions were proposed: adjusting the screen distance and changing the lens spacing. Both methods significantly improved the imaging quality on the human retina, with an increase of over 30% in the average MTF value. A comparison of these methods was conducted, providing valuable references for future VR optical system designs.",40793313,Medical Image Analysis

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is pivotal in precise and accurate tumor characterization owing to its high-resolution, non-invasive nature. This study investigates the synergy among multiple feature representation schemes such as local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Gray-Level Run Length Matrix alongside five learning algorithms namely: k-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and probabilistic neural network (PNN), and CNN. Empirical findings indicate that LBP in conjunction with SVC and CNN obtained high specificity and accuracy, rendering it a promising method for MRI-based tumor diagnosis. Further to investigate the contribution of LBP, Statistical analysis chi-square and p-value tests are used to confirm the significant impact of LBP feature space for identification of brain Tumor. In addition, The SHAP analysis was used to identify the most important features in classification. In a small dataset, CNN obtained 97.8% accuracy while SVC yielded 98.06% accuracy. In subsequent analysis, a large benchmark dataset is also utilized to evaluate the performance of learning algorithms in order to investigate the generalization power of the proposed model. CNN achieves the highest accuracy of 98.9%, followed by SVC at 96.7%. These results highlight CNN's effectiveness in automated, high-precision tumor diagnosis.

Ethical considerations and robustness of artificial neural networks in medical image analysis under data corruption.,"Okunev Michael, Handelman Doron, Handelman Amir",Scientific reports (2025),"Medicine is one of the most sensitive fields in which artificial intelligence (AI) is extensively used, spanning from medical image analysis to clinical support. Specifically, in medicine, where every decision may severely affect human lives, the issue of ensuring that AI systems operate ethically and produce results that align with ethical considerations is of great importance. In this work, we investigate the combination of several key parameters on the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) used for medical image analysis in the presence of data corruption or errors. For this purpose, we examined five different ANN architectures (AlexNet, LeNet 5, VGG16, ResNet-50, and Vision Transformers - ViT), and for each architecture, we checked its performance under varying combinations of training dataset sizes and percentages of images that are corrupted through mislabeling. The image mislabeling simulates deliberate or nondeliberate changes to the dataset, which may cause the AI system to produce unreliable results. We found that the five ANN architectures produce different results for the same task, both for cases with and without dataset modification, which implies that the selection of which ANN architecture to implement may have ethical aspects that need to be considered. We also found that label corruption resulted in a mixture of performance metrics tendencies, indicating that it is difficult to conclude whether label corruption has occurred. Our findings demonstrate the relation between ethics in AI and ANN architecture implementation and AI computational parameters used therefor, and raise awareness of the need to find appropriate ways to determine whether label corruption has occurred.",40790201,Medical Image Analysis

Self-supervised disc and cup segmentation via non-local deformable convolution and adaptive transformer.,"Zhao Wenbo, Wang Yu",SLAS technology (2025),"Optic disc and cup segmentation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, playing a pivotal role in automated pathological image analysis. It enables precise, efficient, and automated diagnosis of ocular conditions, significantly aiding clinicians in real-world medical applications. However, due to the scarcity of medical segmentation data and the insufficient integration of global contextual information, the segmentation accuracy remains suboptimal. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in optic disc and cup cases with complex anatomical structures and ambiguous boundaries. In order to address these limitations, this paper introduces a self-supervised training strategy integrated with a newly designed network architecture to improve segmentation accuracy. Specifically,we initially propose a non-local dual deformable convolutional block,which aims to capture the irregular image patterns(i.e. boundary). Secondly,we modify the traditional vision transformer and design an adaptive K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) transformation block to extract the global semantic context from images. Finally,an initialization strategy based on self-supervised training is proposed to reduce the burden on the network on labeled data.

Dendrite cross attention for high-dose-rate brachytherapy distribution planning.,"Saini Sourav, Liu Xiaofeng",Computers in biology and medicine (2025),"Cervical cancer is a significant global health issue, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) is crucial for its treatment. However, manually creating HDR-BT plans is time-consuming and heavily relies on the planner's expertise, making standardization difficult. This study introduces two advanced deep learning models to address this need: Bi-branch Cross-Attention UNet (BiCA-UNet) and Dendrite Cross-Attention UNet (DCA-UNet). BiCA-UNet enhances the correlation between the CT scan and segmentation maps of the clinical target volume (CTV), applicator, bladder, and rectum. It uses two branches: one processes the stacked input of CT scans and segmentations, and the other focuses on the CTV segmentation. A cross-attention mechanism integrates these branches, improving the model's understanding of the CTV region for accurate dose predictions. Building on BiCA-UNet, DCA-UNet further introduces a primary branch of stacked inputs and three secondary branches for CTV, bladder, and rectum segmentations forming a dendritic structure. Cross attention with bladder and rectum segmentation helps the model understand the regions of organs at risk (OAR), refining dose prediction. Evaluation of these models using multiple metrics indicates that both BiCA-UNet and DCA-UNet significantly improve HDR-BT dose prediction accuracy for various applicator types. The cross-attention mechanisms enhance the feature representation of critical anatomical regions, leading to precise and reliable treatment plans. This research highlights the potential of BiCA-UNet and DCA-UNet in advancing HDR-BT planning, contributing to the standardization of treatment plans, and offering promising directions for future research to improve patient outcomes in the source data.",40789235,Medical Image Analysis

Traditional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans primarily focus on structural abnormalities, limiting real-time physiological assessments. Digital infrared thermography imaging (DITI) has emerged as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool that evaluates thermal emissions from the body, offering valuable insights into musculoskeletal dysfunction. This review explores the principles of DITI, its application in diagnosing degenerative spinal disorders, and its clinical implications. DITI operates on the principle that physiological disturbances - such as inflammation, neuropathy, and vascular irregularities -alter skin temperature distribution, which can be captured using infrared technology. It has shown promise in detecting conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and facet joint degeneration by identifying abnormal thermal asymmetry. While DITI offers advantages such as real-time functional assessment, cost-effectiveness, and early disease detection, challenges related to standardization, environmental variability, and specificity persist. Recent advancements, including artificial intelligence-driven thermal analysis and hybrid imaging approaches, are improving DITI's diagnostic precision and clinical utility.

Visualized breath-hold training for reducing respiratory motion artifacts in liver dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.,"Luo Xin, Chen Gen, Zhang Shufeng, Hu Xuemei, Huang Chao",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery (2025),"Liver dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a critical role in detecting hepatic lesions but is highly susceptible to respiratory motion artifacts. Although advancements in rapid magnetic resonance (MR) acquisition techniques have been made, breath-hold acquisitions are predominantly used for abdominal DCE-MRI due to their superior image quality. Therefore, prescan breath-hold training is essential to improving patients' compliance and minimizing respiratory artifacts. Traditional oral training methods, which rely on operators monitoring chest/abdominal movement, are subjective and often insufficient for DCE-MRI requirements, leading to suboptimal image quality and potential risks from repeated contrast administration. To address these limitations, we developed a novel visual breath-hold training instrument and evaluated its efficacy in reducing respiratory artifacts.",40785901,Medical Image Analysis
Normal reference values of three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography-derived aortic valve annular dimensions in healthy adults-a detailed analysis from the MAGYAR-Healthy Study.,"Nemes Attila, Ambrus Nóra, Lengyel Csaba",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery (2025),"Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography from transthoracic approach is the accepted tool to examine expected pathologies of the aortic valve (AV) in the daily clinical routine.

Reducing the radiation dose increases image noise, compromising image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms can reduce noise; however, they can also alter image texture and limit lesion detection. Deep-learning image reconstruction (DLIR) represents a promising alternative, but its efficacy in ultra-low-dose (ULD) hepatic CT for detecting small, low-contrast lesions remains underexplored. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate a novel real-time DLIR algorithm in ULD hepatic CT, focusing on image quality and lesion detection.",40785866,Medical Image Analysis

Cytogenotoxic Activity of Gadoteric Acid in SH-SY5Y Cells and XIAP Interaction With Molecular Docking.,"Bilgin Batuhan, Husunet Mehmet Tahir, Kenger Ibrahim Halil",Journal of applied toxicology : JAT (2025),"Gadoteric acid is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) used to improve image quality in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although it is also used in the diagnosis and prognosis of neuroblastoma, its effect on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells remains unclear as a scientific gap. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gadoteric acid on cytogenotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and its affinity with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). After treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with gadoteric acid (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mM), cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. After determining the IC50 value of gadoteric acid, the DNA damage effect of gadoteric acid (3.35, 6.7, 13.47, and 26.84 mM) on SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by Comet assay. Molecular docking analysis was carried out to identify the binding affinity of gadoteric acid to XIAP. Gadoteric acid (10 and 100 mM) significantly increased cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Gadoteric acid (3.35, 6.7, 13.47, and 26.84 mM) caused a statistically significant increase in Genetic Damage Index (GDI) level in SH-SY5Y cells (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Gadoteric acid (13.47 and 26.84 mM) also significantly increased the Damaged Cell Index (DCI) level in neuroblastoma cells (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). The results of our study indicate that gadoteric acid used in MRI shows a cytogenotoxic effect on neuroblastoma cells and binds to XIAP with high affinity. These findings may provide insight into the use of gadoteric acid in the treatment of neuroblastoma and the molecular apoptosis mechanism of gadoteric acid.",40784725,Medical Image Analysis

Artificial intelligence with feature fusion empowered enhanced brain stroke detection and classification for disabled persons using biomedical images.,"Alsieni Mohammed, Alyoubi Khaled H",Scientific reports (2025),"Brain stroke is an illness which affects almost every age group, particularly people over 65. There are two significant kinds of strokes: ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Blockage of brain vessels causes an ischemic stroke, while cracks in blood vessels in or around the brain cause a hemorrhagic stroke. In the prompt analysis of brain stroke, patients can live an easier life. Recognizing strokes using medical imaging is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Conversely, access to innovative imaging methods is restricted, particularly in emerging states, so it is challenging to analyze brain stroke cases of disabled people appropriately. Hence, the development of more accurate, faster, and more reliable diagnostic models for the timely recognition and efficient treatment of ischemic stroke is greatly needed. Artificial intelligence technologies, primarily deep learning (DL), have been widely employed in medical imaging, utilizing automated detection methods. This paper presents an Enhanced Brain Stroke Detection and Classification using Artificial Intelligence with Feature Fusion Technologies (EBSDC-AIFFT) model. This paper aims to develop an enhanced brain stroke detection system for individuals with disabilities, utilizing biomedical images to improve diagnostic accuracy. Initially, the image pre-processing stage involves various steps, including resizing, normalization, data augmentation, and data splitting, to enhance image quality. In addition, the EBSDC-AIFFT model combines the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, the convolutional block attention module-ResNet18 method, and the multi-axis vision transformer technique for feature extraction. Finally, the variational autoencoder (VAE) model is implemented for the classification process. The performance validation of the EBSDC-AIFFT technique is performed under the brain stroke CT image dataset. The comparison study of the EBSDC-AIFFT technique demonstrated a superior accuracy value of 99.09% over existing models.",40783612,Medical Image Analysis

We analyzed 562 Caucasian patients hospitalized due to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), divided into two groups based on length of stay (LOS): ≤ 8 days (n = 287; 51.07%) and > 8 days (n = 275; 48.93%). In the ≤ 8 days group, 203 patients (70.73%) were male, while in the > 8 days group, 202 patients (73.45%) were male. Data on sociodemographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment details, and patient-reported health status (KCCQ-12) were collected. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of prolonged hospitalization. Patients with longer LOS had higher NYHA class (p < 0.001), greater comorbidity burden (p = 0.0019), longer intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) stay (p < 0.001), and higher in-hospital mortality (p = 0.0006). They also showed elevated NT-proBNP (p < 0.0001), procalcitonin (p = 0.03), and creatinine (p = 0.0002), and lower hemoglobin (p = 0.004), hematocrit (p = 0.014), and sodium (p = 0.0325). In the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of prolonged hospitalization included treatment with norepinephrine (OR = 18.41), dopamine (OR = 8.62), and oral iron therapy (OR = 3.25). Conversely, protective factors associated with a reduced risk of prolonged hospitalization were higher KCCQ-12 scores (OR = 0.98), higher systolic blood pressure at admission (OR = 0.99), and prior statin use (OR = 0.56). In the HEROES study, prolonged hospitalization among ADHF patients was associated with more severe symptoms of heart failure decompensation higher comorbidity load, impaired functional and laboratory parameters and need for longer stay in ICCU.

STARFormer: A novel spatio-temporal aggregation reorganization transformer of FMRI for brain disorder diagnosis.,"Dong Wenhao, Li Yueyang, Zeng Weiming, Chen Lei, Yan Hongjie et al.",Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society (2025),"Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a spatio-temporal aggregation reorganization transformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

OCELOT 2023: Cell detection from cell-tissue interaction challenge.,"Shin JaeWoong, Ryu Jeongun, Puche Aaron Valero, Lee Jinhee, Brattoli Biagio et al.",Medical image analysis (2025),"Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models.

Recurrent inference machine for medical image registration.,"Zhang Yi, Zhao Yidong, Xue Hui, Kellman Peter, Klein Stefan et al.",Medical image analysis (2025),"Image registration is essential for medical image applications where alignment of voxels across multiple images is needed for qualitative or quantitative analysis. With recent advances in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modeling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver for the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input. We extensively evaluated RIIR on brain MRI, lung CT, and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only 5% of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning.

This paper proposes a workaround against these challenges aiming to learn unbiased models solely from certainties. Concretely, during the labeling stage, only regions of interest confidently discerned by annotators are required to be labeled, not only increasing label quantity but also improving label quality. This approach formulates the positive-unlabeled (PU) segmentation problem and motivates to capture uncertainty in ambiguous regions. We thus delve into data-generating assumptions in the PU segmentation context and propose Probabilistic PU Segmentation Networks (ProPU-Nets) to tackle problems abovementioned. This framework employs the expectation-maximization algorithm to gradually estimate true masks, and more importantly, by encoding plausible segmentation variants in a latent space, uncertainty estimation can be naturally embedded into the PU segmentation framework. Benefitting from the framework's unbiasedness, a semi-supervised PU segmentation method is also proposed, which can further excavate performance gains from unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on LIDC, RIGA, and LA datasets, and comprehensively compared with state-of-the-art methods in label-efficient medical image segmentation. The results justify the method's effectiveness and practical prospect.",40779832,Medical Image Analysis
Interpretable multi-scale deep learning to detect malignancy in cell blocks and cytological smears of pleural effusion and identify aggressive endometrial cancer.,"Wang Ching-Wei, Muzakky Hikam, Chung Yu-Pang, Lai Po-Jen, Chao Tai-Kuang",Medical image analysis (2025),"The pleura is a serous membrane that surrounds the surface of the lungs. The visceral surface secretes fluid into the serous cavity, while the parietal surface ensures that the fluid is properly absorbed. However, when this balance is disrupted, it leads to the formation of pleural Effusion. The most common malignant pleural effusion (MPE) caused by lung cancer or breast cancer, and benign pleural effusions (BPE) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, heart failure, or infections related to pneumonia. Today, with the rapid advancement of treatment protocols, accurately diagnosing MPE has become increasingly important. Although cytology smears and cell blocks examinations of pleural effusion are the clinical gold standards for diagnosing MPE, the diagnostic accuracy of these tools can be affected by certain limitations, such as low sensitivity, diagnostic variability across different regions and significant inter-observer variability, leading to a certain proportion of misdiagnoses. This study presents a deep learning (DL) framework, namely Interpretable Multi-scale Attention DL with Self-Supervised Learning Feature Encoder (IMA-SSL), to identifyMPE or BPE using 194 Cytological smears whole-slide images (WSIs) and 188 cell blocks WSIs. The use of DL on WSIs of pleural effusion allows for preliminary results to be obtained in a short time, giving patients the opportunity for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The experimental results show that the proposed IMA-SSL consistently obtained superior performance and outperformed five state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in malignancy prediction on both cell block and cytological smear datasets and also in identification of aggressive endometrial cancer (EC) using a public TCGA dataset. Fisher's exact test confirmed a highly significant correlation between the outputs of the proposed model and the slide status in the EC and pleural effusion datasets (p < 0.001), substantiating the model's predictive reliability. The proposed method has the potential for practical clinical application in the foreseeable future. It can directly detect the presence of malignant tumor cells from cost-effective cell blocks and pleural effusion cytology smears and facilitate personalized cancer treatment decisions.",40779831,Medical Image Analysis
MedCLIP-SAMv2: Towards universal text-driven medical image segmentation.,"Koleilat Taha, Asgariandehkordi Hojat, Rivaz Hassan, Xiao Yiming",Medical image analysis (2025),"Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathologies in medical images is essential for modern disease diagnosis, clinical research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing robust segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is an active field of research. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks with SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels in a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive validation across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.

Here, we define a cell-intrinsic role for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling in the development of a CD301b+ subset of terminally differentiated cDC2s, in addition to CD103+XCR1+ cDC1s. Unbiased single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CD11c+ cells identified both immature and differentiated lung cDC populations. GM-CSF deficiency disrupted antiapoptotic Bcl2a1 up-regulation and impaired progression to the CD301b+ transcriptional state. Despite the positioning of CD301b+ cDC2s in lymphoid cell-rich adventitial cuff areas, hematopoietic GM-CSF was dispensable for their development. Instead, alveolar epithelial type 2 cell-derived GM-CSF was required for CD301b+ cDC2 formation and pulmonary type 2 immune responses, highlighting the central role of GM-CSF signaling in shaping the pulmonary myeloid landscape.",40779647,Medical Image Analysis

Senescent cell heterogeneity and responses to senolytic treatment are related to cell cycle status during senescence induction.,"Neri Francesco, Zheng Shuyuan, Watson Mark A, Desprez Pierre-Yves, Gerencser Akos A et al.",Aging (2025),"Cellular senescence has been strongly linked to aging and age-related diseases. It is well established that the phenotype of senescent cells is highly heterogeneous and influenced by their cell type and senescence-inducing stimulus. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies identified heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. However, proof of functional differences between such subpopulations is lacking. To identify functionally distinct senescent cell subpopulations, we employed high-content image analysis to measure senescence marker expression in primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. We found that G2-arrested senescent cells feature higher senescence marker expression than G1-arrested senescent cells. To investigate functional differences, we compared IL-6 secretion and response to ABT263 senolytic treatment in G1 and G2 senescent cells. We determined that G2-arrested senescent cells secrete more IL-6 and are more sensitive to ABT263 than G1-arrested cells. We hypothesize that cell cycle dependent DNA content is a key contributor to the heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. This study demonstrates the existence of functionally distinct senescent subpopulations even in culture. This data provides the first evidence of selective cell response to senolytic treatment among senescent cell subpopulations. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the senescent cell heterogeneity in the development of future senolytic therapies.",40778874,Medical Image Analysis
Five-Year Clinical and MRI-Based Outcomes After Cartilage Repair With or Without ACL Reconstruction: Worse Clinical Outcome after ACL Reconstruction Does not Affect Cartilage Repair Tissue Quality.,"Koenig Felix R M, Vetchy Veronika, Wollner Gregor, Kern Maximilian, Raudner Marcus et al.",Cartilage (2025),"ObjectivesCartilage repair (CR) surgery and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) are common joint procedures, particularly in younger patients. However, the impact of prior or concurrent ACL-R on the outcomes of CR remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate whether ACL-R affects the structural quality and clinical outcomes of CR tissue.MethodsIn this retrospective multicenter study, 71 patients undergoing CR were followed up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluations at 3, 12, and 60 months. Of these, 22 patients underwent ACL-R before or during CR. Morphological assessment was performed using Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) 2.0 scores; compositional analysis included T2 mapping (n = 45). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) were assessed at all time points. Statistical tests included the Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and simulation-based power analysis.ResultsMOCART 2.0 scores and T2 mapping values showed no significant group differences at any time point. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in PROMs from baseline to 60 months. However, at 60 months, the ACL-R group had significantly lower PROMs than the non-ACL-R group.ConclusionAlthough long-term clinical outcomes were worse in patients with ACL-R, all PROMs improved significantly from baseline to 60 months in both groups. MRI showed no significant differences in focal CR tissue quality, suggesting structural success regardless of ACL-R. While ACL-R patients remain at higher risk of joint degeneration, they can still experience mid-term clinical benefit from CR. These findings support its use in ACL-R patients when joint function is properly restored and expectations are managed.",40778441,Medical Image Analysis

This technique provides detailed information on plaque morphology and composition, enabling the identification of high-risk features associated with coronary artery disease and adverse cardiovascular events. However, despite advancements in imaging technology and image assessment, the adoption of IVOCT in clinical practice remains limited. Manual plaque assessment by experts is time-consuming, prone to errors, and affected by high inter-observer variability. To increase productivity, precision, and reproducibility, researchers are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques into IVOCT analysis pipelines. Machine learning algorithms, trained on labelled datasets, have demonstrated robust classification of various plaque types. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, further improve performance by enabling automatic feature extraction. This reduces the reliance on predefined criteria, which often require domain-specific expertise, and allow for more flexible and comprehensive plaque characterization. AI-driven approaches aim to facilitate the integration of IVOCT into routine clinical practice, potentially transforming this technique from a research tool into a powerful aid for clinical decision-making. This narrative review aims to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of AI-based methods for analyzing IVOCT images of coronary arteries, with a focus on plaque characterization, and (ii) explore the clinical translation of AI to IVOCT, highlighting AI-powered tools for plaque characterization currently intended for commercial and/or clinical use. While these technologies represent significant progress, current solutions remain limited in the range of plaque features these methods can assess. Additionally, many of these solutions are confined to specific regulatory or research settings. Therefore, this review highlights the need for further advancements in AI-based IVOCT analysis, emphasizing the importance of additional validation and improved integration with clinical systems to enhance plaque characterization, support clinical decision-making, and advance risk prediction.",40776963,Medical Image Analysis

Quantitative image analysis of the extracellular matrix of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and high grade dysplasia via two-photon microscopy.,"Makkithaya Kausalya Neelavara, Chen Wei-Chung, Wu Chun-Chieh, Chen Ming-Chi, Wang Wei-Hsun et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) are two different pathological entities; however, they sometimes share similarities in histological structure depending on the context. Thus, distinguishing between the two may require careful examination by a pathologist and consideration of clinical findings. Unlike previous studies on cancer diagnosis using two-photon microscopy, quantitative analysis or machine learning (ML) algorithms need to be used to determine the subtle structural changes in images and the structural features that are statistically meaningful in cancer development. In this study, we aimed to quantitatively distinguish between SCC and HGD using two-photon microscopy combined with ML. Tissue samples were categorized into two groups: Group 1, primary SCC vs. metachronous HGD (SCC-HGD) and Group 2, primary HGD vs. metachronous HGD (HGD-HGD). We quantitatively analyzed second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon fluorescence (TPF) signals from two-photon microscopy imaging of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract the textural features of the tissue images, and support vector machine (SVM), for classification of the tissue images based on their pathologies.

An open-source platform for structured annotation and computational workflows in digital pathology research.,"Lianas Luca, Del Rio Mauro, Pireddu Luca, Aspegren Oskar, Giunchi Francesca et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"The rapid evolution of digital pathology has enabled large-scale data acquisition, driving sophisticated clinical research and advancing the development of AI-driven tools. These innovations have also revolutionised histopathological slide review, especially the annotation step (i.e. the process of marking specific areas of interest on glass-mounted tissue samples to add relevant clinical information) by digitising the process, enhancing precision and efficiency, and facilitating collaboration. However, currently available open-source annotation tools typically employ single-label approaches that provide a flat representation of whole-slide images (WSI), limiting their ability to capture the complexity of the diagnosis-significant elements in a detailed and structured way. Furthermore, the difficulty of strictly following precise review protocols and lack of provenance tracking during annotation processes can result in high variability and limit reproducibility and reusability of the collected data. In this work we present the CRS4 Digital Pathology Platform (CDPP), an open-source system for research studies that manages WSI collections and focuses on high-quality, structured annotations, gathered according to well-defined protocols. Its main features include: (1) structured, multi-label morphological and clinical image annotation; (2) support for controlled but customisable annotation protocols; (3) dedicated annotation tools to facilitate enhanced accuracy, efficiency and consistency in the annotation process; and (4) workflow-based computational analysis with integrated provenance tracking.

Photon-counting detector computed tomography meets orthopantomography: a cinematic rendering solution for superior structural visualization.,"Stadlinger B, Engel K, Al-Haj Husain A, Alkadhi H",International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery (2025),"This technical note introduces an innovative technique for overlaying photorealistic three-dimensional (3D) visualization cinematic renderings of ultra-high-resolution photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) scans onto conventional orthopantomography (OPG) images, enhancing visualization and aiding in the detection of subsurface structures and incidental findings. OPG is commonly used to assess dentomaxillofacial conditions, generating a summation image on a two-dimensional (2D) plane through a circular tomographic path. While useful for the initial evaluation, OPG has limitations, such as overlapping structures and restricted soft tissue visualization. More detailed analysis often requires 3D imaging modalities like cone beam computed tomography or conventional computed tomography. Recently introduced PCD-CT provides high-resolution images with lower noise, enhanced soft tissue contrast, and reduced artefacts. A novel technique of overlaying a photorealistic 3D cinematic rendering of a PCD-CT scan onto a conventional 2D OPG image of the same patient is introduced that enhances OPG by revealing subsurface structures such as blood vessels and improves understanding of the 3D anatomy. By associating the 3D anatomy with this 2D image, the technique enhances the clinician's understanding of three-dimensionality and may potentially aid in the detection of incidental findings in OPGs, such as calcifications in the angle of the jaw.",40774873,Medical Image Analysis

A Hybrid Model for Brain Tumor Classification via Deep Feature Extraction and Optimized Classifier Weighting.,"Chhikara Sarita, Dass Rajeshwar",Biomedical physics & engineering express (2025),"Accurate and automated brain tumor classification is crucial for early treatment planning and effective diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a novel multiclass brain tumor classification approach that utilizes deep features extracted from the pre-trained VGG-16 model, to enhance the classification of brain tumor using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) with majority voting. VGG-16, effectively captured complex and discriminative features from Magnetic Resonance Images.

Contrastive learning and prior knowledge-induced feature extraction network for prediction of high-risk recurrence areas in Gliomas.,"Wu Boya, Cao Jianyun, Xiong Wei, Lv Yanchun, Zhao Guohua et al.",Medical image analysis (2025),"Gliomas can easily recur even after standard treatments, and their recurrence may be related to insufficient radiation doses received by high-risk recurrence areas (HRA). Therefore, HRA prediction can help clinical experts in formulating effective radiotherapy plans. However, research on HRA prediction using early postoperative conventional MRI images with total resection is lacking. This gap is due to multifold challenges, including visually minimal differences between HRA and non-HRA and small dataset size caused by missing follow-up data. A contrastive learning and prior knowledge-induced feature extraction network (CLPKnet) to explore HRA-related features and achieve HRA prediction was proposed in this paper. First, a contrastive and multisequence learning-based encoder was proposed to effectively extract diverse features across multiple MRI sequences around the operative cavity. Specifically, a contrastive learning method was employed to pretrain the encoder, which enabled it to capture subtle differences between HRA and non-HRA regions while mitigating the challenges posed by the limited dataset size. Second, clinical prior knowledge was incorporated into the CLPKnet to guide the model in learning the patterns of glioma growth and improve its discriminative capability for identifying HRA regions. Third, a dual-focus fusion module was utilized to explore important sequential features and spatial regions and effectively fused multisequence features to provide complementary information associated with glioma recurrence. Fourth, to balance clinical needs and task difficulty, we used a patch-based prediction method to predict the recurrent probability. The CLPKnet was validated on a multicenter dataset from four hospitals, and a remarkable performance was achieved. Moreover, the interpretability and robustness of our method were evaluated to illustrate its effectiveness and credibility. Therefore, the CLPKnet displays a great application potential for HRA prediction. The codes will be available at https://github.com/Meiyan88/CLPKnet.",40774099,Medical Image Analysis

Brain Latent Progression: Individual-based spatiotemporal disease progression on 3D Brain MRIs via latent diffusion.,"Puglisi Lemuel, Alexander Daniel C, Ravì Daniele",Medical image analysis (2025),"The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction at the global and voxel level. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods.

EATHOA: Elite-evolved hiking algorithm for global optimization and precise multi-thresholding image segmentation in intracerebral hemorrhage images.,"Abdel-Salam Mahmoud, Houssein Essam H, Emam Marwa M, Samee Nagwan Abdel, Gharehchopogh Farhad Soleimanian et al.",Computers in biology and medicine (2025),"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening condition caused by bleeding in the brain, with high mortality rates, particularly in the acute phase. Accurate diagnosis through medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in early intervention and treatment. However, existing segmentation methods, such as region-growing, clustering, and deep learning, face significant limitations when applied to complex images like ICH, especially in multi-threshold image segmentation (MTIS). As the number of thresholds increases, these methods often become computationally expensive and exhibit degraded segmentation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Elite-Adaptive-Turbulent Hiking Optimization Algorithm (EATHOA), an enhanced version of the Hiking Optimization Algorithm (HOA), specifically designed for high-dimensional and multimodal optimization problems like ICH image segmentation. EATHOA integrates three novel strategies including Elite Opposition-Based Learning (EOBL) for improving population diversity and exploration, Adaptive k-Average-Best Mutation (AKAB) for dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation, and a Turbulent Operator (TO) for escaping local optima and enhancing the convergence rate. Extensive experiments were conducted on the CEC2017 and CEC2022 benchmark functions to evaluate EATHOA's global optimization performance, where it consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed EATHOA was then applied to solve the MTIS problem in ICH images at six different threshold levels. EATHOA achieved peak values of PSNR (34.4671), FSIM (0.9710), and SSIM (0.8816), outperforming recent methods in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the superior performance of EATHOA and its potential as a powerful tool for medical image analysis, offering an effective and computationally efficient solution for the complex challenges of ICH image segmentation.",40773994,Medical Image Analysis

Categorized and individualized behavioral phenotyping approaches for control and triple-hit schizophrenia-like model rats in acute and chronic reward-based systems: A pilot study.,"Hernadi Zsofia, Kormoczi Laszlo, Adlan Leatitia G, Kekesi Gabriella, Büki Alexandra et al.",PloS one (2025),"A wide variety of acute test procedures are used for the behavioral characterization of schizophrenia rodent models, but prolonged observation in home-cage systems remains underexplored. This study aimed to profile the behavior of control (Wistar) and triple-hit schizophrenia-like (Wisket) model rats under two reward-based test conditions: the acute Ambitus test, a simple reward-collection task, and the delay-discounting paradigm in the HomeManner system, designed for extended observation periods. Wisket rats exhibited significant behavioral impairments compared to Wistar rats in the Ambitus test. However, in the HomeManner system, no significant group differences were observed at the cohort level due to heterogeneous individual behavioral patterns. Specifically, only half of the rats explored both food-providing trays, while others focused on one or ignored both. Subgroup analysis, based on tray activity patterns, revealed that Wisket rats displayed impaired cognitive processes and greater intolerance to delayed food rewards. Furthermore, personalized analysis indicated lower behavioral variability within the Wisket group compared to controls. The absence of a strong correlation between performance in the Ambitus and HomeManner tests suggests that these assessments capture distinct behavioral characteristics. This pilot study provides an extended behavioral phenotyping of rat substrains under both acute and chronic conditions. The automated HomeManner system demonstrates potential as a valuable tool for prolonged behavioral assessments. Importantly, this study underscores the value of categorized and personalized analyses in revealing behavioral differences that may not be apparent in group-level comparisons, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of preclinical research.",40773442,Medical Image Analysis
Uncertainty-aware Medical Diagnostic Phrase Identification and Grounding.,"Zou Ke, Bai Yang, Liu Bo, Chen Yidi, Chen Zhihao et al.",IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence (2025),"Medical phrase grounding is crucial for identifying relevant regions in medical images based on phrase queries, facilitating accurate image analysis and diagnosis. However, current methods rely on manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, reducing efficiency and increasing the workload for clinicians. Additionally, the lack of model confidence estimation limits clinical trust and usability. In this paper, we introduce a novel task-Medical Report Grounding (MRG)-which aims to directly identify diagnostic phrases and their corresponding grounding boxes from medical reports in an end-to-end manner. To address this challenge, we propose uMedGround, a robust and reliable framework that leverages a multimodal large language model to predict diagnostic phrases by embedding a unique token, $\lt $$\mathtt {BOX}$$\gt $, into the vocabulary to enhance detection capabilities. A vision encoder-decoder processes the embedded token and input image to generate grounding boxes. Critically, uMedGround incorporates an uncertainty-aware prediction model, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of grounding predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that uMedGround outperforms state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods and fine-tuned large visual-language models, validating its effectiveness and reliability. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the MRG task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain.

Accelerating Drug Translation: Role of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Plaque Imaging Candidates as Surrogate Biomarkers.,"Baskaran Lohendran, Dutta Utkarsh, Xiaomeng Wang, Gray Michael Patrick, Chan Mark et al.",JACC. Cardiovascular imaging (2025),"There is an unmet need for new pathways to evaluate therapeutic targets and drugs for coronary artery disease (CAD). The use of major adverse cardiovascular events as a primary outcome is advantageous for rigor, but challenges related to large sample size requirements, long study durations, and associated costs and risks remain major disincentives for key stakeholders. Until now, a robust, well-validated surrogate biomarker for cardiovascular events that reflects atherosclerosis itself has been lacking. This is particularly important as new therapeutic candidates targeting inflammation and factors downstream of low-density lipoprotein and other well-recognized factors continue to emerge. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as an ideal modality to image, characterize, and quantify specific plaque components, with potential for a more formal role in the CAD drug development pipeline. This review examines both morphological (high-risk plaque) and quantitative (specific plaque components) measures, considering their pathophysiological correlation with other imaging measures of atherosclerosis, evidence for the association of each component with major adverse cardiovascular events, and their responsiveness to effective drug treatments. Given the rapid advancement in coronary CTA acquisition and analysis technology, there is an urgent need for coordination and collaboration among key stakeholders, including imaging hardware and software companies, pharmaceutical companies, as well as clinicians, patients, regulators, and payers. Progress in this area, and the opportunities that may follow for the broader cardiovascular community if standardized coronary CTA endpoints are validated as surrogates for clinical drug trials, could accelerate innovation and enhance efficiency in CAD drug development.",40769623,Medical Image Analysis
Attend-and-Refine: Interactive keypoint estimation and quantitative cervical vertebrae analysis for bone age assessment.,"Kim Jinhee, Kim Taesung, Kim Taewoo, Kim Dong-Wook, Ahn Byungduk et al.",Medical image analysis (2025),"In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network, which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback, coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging.

Self-consistent recursive diffusion bridge for medical image translation.,"Arslan Fuat, Kabas Bilal, Dalmaz Onat, Ozbey Muzaffer, Çukur Tolga",Medical image analysis (2025),"Denoising diffusion models (DDM) have gained recent traction in medical image translation given their high training stability and image fidelity. DDMs learn a multi-step denoising transformation that progressively maps random Gaussian-noise images provided as input onto target-modality images as output, while receiving indirect guidance from source-modality images via a separate static channel. This denoising transformation diverges significantly from the task-relevant source-to-target modality transformation, as source images are governed by a non-noise distribution. In turn, DDMs can suffer from suboptimal source-modality guidance and performance losses in medical image translation. Here, we propose a novel self-consistent recursive diffusion bridge (SelfRDB) that leverages direct source-modality guidance within its diffusion process for improved performance in medical image translation. Unlike DDMs, SelfRDB devises a novel forward process with the start-point taken as the target image, and the end-point defined based on the source image. Intermediate image samples across the process are expressed via a normal distribution whose mean is taken as a convex combination of start-end points, and whose variance is controlled by additive noise. Unlike regular diffusion bridges that prescribe zero noise variance at start-end points and high noise variance at mid-point of the process, we propose a novel noise scheduling with monotonically increasing variance towards the end-point in order to facilitate information transfer between the two modalities and boost robustness against measurement noise. To further enhance sampling accuracy in each reverse step, we propose a novel sampling procedure where the network recursively generates a transient-estimate of the target image until convergence onto a self-consistent solution. Comprehensive experiments in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation indicate that SelfRDB achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality.",40769096,Medical Image Analysis
SemiSAM+: Rethinking semi-supervised medical image segmentation in the era of foundation models.,"Zhang Yichi, Lv Bohao, Xue Le, Zhang Wenbo, Liu Yuchen et al.",Medical image analysis (2025),"Deep learning-based medical image segmentation typically requires large amount of labeled data for training, making it less applicable in clinical settings due to high annotation cost. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an appealing strategy due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods. Beyond existing model-centric advancements of SSL by designing novel regularization strategies, we anticipate a paradigmatic shift due to the emergence of promptable segmentation foundation models with universal segmentation capabilities using positional prompts represented by Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we present SemiSAM+, a foundation model-driven SSL framework to efficiently learn from limited labeled data for medical image segmentation. SemiSAM+ consists of one or multiple promptable foundation models as generalist models, and a trainable task-specific segmentation model as specialist model. For a given new segmentation task, the training is based on the specialist-generalist collaborative learning procedure, where the trainable specialist model delivers positional prompts to interact with the frozen generalist models to acquire pseudo-labels, and then the generalist model output provides the specialist model with informative and efficient supervision which benefits the automatic segmentation and prompt generation in turn. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and one in-house clinical dataset demonstrate that SemiSAM+ achieves significant performance improvement, especially under extremely limited annotation scenarios, and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily adapted to different specialist and generalist models.",40769095,Medical Image Analysis
PitVis-2023 challenge: Workflow recognition in videos of endoscopic pituitary surgery.,"Das Adrito, Khan Danyal Z, Psychogyios Dimitrios, Zhang Yitong, Hanrahan John G et al.",Medical image analysis (2025),"The field of computer vision applied to videos of minimally invasive surgery is ever-growing. Workflow recognition pertains to the automated recognition of various aspects of a surgery, including: which surgical steps are performed; and which surgical instruments are used. This information can later be used to assist clinicians when learning the surgery or during live surgery. The Pituitary Vision (PitVis) 2023 Challenge tasks the community to step and instrument recognition in videos of endoscopic pituitary surgery. This is a particularly challenging task when compared to other minimally invasive surgeries due to: the smaller working space, which limits and distorts vision; and higher frequency of instrument and step switching, which requires more precise model predictions. Participants were provided with 25-videos, with results presented at the MICCAI-2023 conference as part of the Endoscopic Vision 2023 Challenge in Vancouver, Canada, on 08-Oct-2023. There were 18-submissions from 9-teams across 6-countries, using a variety of deep learning models.

Controllable Mask Diffusion Model for medical annotation synthesis with semantic information extraction.,"Heo Chanyeong, Jung Jaehee",Computers in biology and medicine (2025),"Medical segmentation, a prominent task in medical image analysis utilizing artificial intelligence, plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and depends heavily on the quality of the training data. However, the availability of sufficient data is constrained by strict privacy regulations associated with medical data. To mitigate this issue, research on data augmentation has gained significant attention. Medical segmentation tasks require paired datasets consisting of medical images and annotation images, also known as mask images, which represent lesion areas or radiological information within the medical images. Consequently, it is essential to apply data augmentation to both image types. This study proposes a Controllable Mask Diffusion Model, a novel approach capable of controlling and generating new masks. This model leverages the binary structure of the mask to extract semantic information, namely, the mask's size, location, and count, which is then applied as multi-conditional input to a diffusion model via a regressor. Through the regressor, newly generated masks conform to the input semantic information, thereby enabling input-driven controllable generation. Additionally, a technique that analyzes correlation within semantic information was devised for large-scale data synthesis. The generative capacity of the proposed model was evaluated against real datasets, and the model's ability to control and generate new masks based on previously unseen semantic information was confirmed. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the model was demonstrated by augmenting the data with the generated data, applying it to segmentation tasks, and comparing the performance with and without augmentation. Additionally, experiments were conducted on single-label and multi-label masks, yielding superior results for both types. This demonstrates the potential applicability of this study to various areas within the medical field.",40768914,Medical Image Analysis

Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content. Purpose To develop and validate MRSegmentator, a retrospective cross-modality deep learning model for multiorgan segmentation of MRI scans. Materials and Methods This retrospective study trained MRSegmentator on 1,200 manually annotated UK Biobank Dixon MRI sequences (50 participants), 221 in-house abdominal MRI sequences (177 patients), and 1228 CT scans from the TotalSegmentator-CT dataset. A human-in-the-loop annotation workflow leveraged cross-modality transfer learning from an existing CT segmentation model to segment 40 anatomic structures. The model's performance was evaluated on 900 MRI sequences from 50 participants in the German National Cohort (NAKO), 60 MRI sequences from AMOS22 dataset, and 29 MRI sequences from TotalSegmentator-MRI. Reference standard manual annotations were used for comparison. Metrics to assess segmentation quality included Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical analyses included organ-and sequence-specific mean ± SD reporting and two-sided t tests for demographic effects. Results 139 participants were evaluated; demographic information was available for 70 (mean age 52.7 years ± 14.0 [SD], 36 female). Across all test datasets, MRSegmentator demonstrated high class wise DSC for well-defined organs (lungs: 0.81-0.96, heart: 0.81-0.94) and organs with anatomic variability (liver: 0.82-0.96, kidneys: 0.77-0.95). Smaller structures showed lower DSC (portal/splenic veins: 0.64-0.78, adrenal glands: 0.56-0.69). The average DSC on the external testing using NAKO data, ranged from 0.85 ± 0.08 for T2-HASTE to 0.91 ± 0.05 for in-phase sequences.
