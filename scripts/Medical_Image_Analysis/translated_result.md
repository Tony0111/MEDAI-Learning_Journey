| Abemaciclib impairs glioblastoma sphere formation by targeting the GSK3β-mediated transcriptional regulation of CD44 and TCF7L2. | 阿贝西利通过靶向GSK3β介导的CD44和TCF7L2转录调控来抑制胶质母细胞瘤球体形成。 | Liang Muh-Lii, Chen Chun-Han, Lin Ya-Ching, Lin Yu-Chen, Liu Yun-Ru et al. | Cancer gene therapy (2025) | Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor partly driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Abemaciclib demonstrates the potential for treating GBM, although its mechanisms beyond RB phosphorylation are not fully understood. This study reveals that Abemaciclib diminishes GBM sphere formation by influencing EMT pathways via GSK3β-mediated regulation of CD44 and TCF7L2. Treatment with Abemaciclib significantly hindered sphere formation in GBM cells, and transcriptomic analysis indicated EMT pathways suppression. Mechanistically, Abemaciclib consistently lowered the expression of CD44 and TCF7L2 in both parental and sphere cells by inhibiting GSK3β phosphorylation. A pharmacological GSK3β inhibitor produced similar effects, reinforcing the existence of a GSK3β-CD44/TCF7L2 axis. Moreover, orthotopic xenografts confirmed reduced tumor growth and CD44 expression in vivo. Analyses of TCGA and CGGA datasets revealed that the mesenchymal GBM subtype (MES-GBM), linked with poor outcomes, exhibits elevated EMT gene expression. Treatment of MES-like LN229 cells with Abemaciclib resulted in decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β and reductions in EMT-related gene expression. Our findings highlight a novel EMT-suppressive action of Abemaciclib, illustrating its therapeutic potential for targeting the CSCs and for treating the MES-GBM. This research provides mechanistic insights and justification for repurposing Abemaciclib as targeted therapies for aggressive glioblastoma. | 多形性胶质母细胞瘤（GBM）是一种侵袭性脑肿瘤，其部分驱动因素为癌症干细胞（CSCs）。阿贝西利虽展现出治疗GBM的潜力，但其除RB磷酸化外的机制尚未完全阐明。本研究发现，阿贝西利通过GSK3β介导的CD44与TCF7L2调控影响EMT通路，从而抑制GBM细胞球形成。阿贝西利处理显著阻碍了GBM细胞的成球能力，转录组分析显示EMT通路受到抑制。机制上，阿贝西利通过抑制GSK3β磷酸化，持续降低亲代细胞和球状细胞中CD44与TCF7L2的表达。使用GSK3β药理抑制剂可产生类似效应，证实GSK3β-CD44/TCF7L2轴的存在。原位移植瘤实验进一步验证了该药物在体内能抑制肿瘤生长并降低CD44表达。通过对TCGA和CGGA数据库分析发现，与不良预后相关的间质型GBM亚型（MES-GBM）表现出EMT基因高表达。阿贝西利处理MES样LN229细胞后，GSK3β磷酸化水平及EMT相关基因表达均下降。本研究揭示了阿贝西利抑制EMT通路的新机制，阐明了其靶向CSCs及治疗MES-GBM的潜力，为将该药物重新用于侵袭性胶质母细胞瘤的靶向治疗提供了理论依据。 | 40813896 | Medical Image Analysis |
| A novel approach in diagnosing knee osteoarthritis for content based image retrieval in big data analytics and medical images. | 一种基于大数据分析和医学图像内容检索的膝关节骨关节炎诊断新方法。 | Bozdag Pinar Gundogan, Mutlu Hurşit Burak, Karaduman Mucahit, Yildirim Muhammed, Khan M Attique et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | The rapid growth in database size due to technological advances has led to difficulties in locating and accessing specific data components. While deep learning and other machine learning architectures are promising in retrieving data components, their effectiveness is more pronounced when addressing groups of diseases. On the contrary, this effectiveness decreases when large data sets are accessed. Content-based Image retrieval (CBIR) methods are used in large data sets. In this study, knee osteoarthritis detection was performed using a developed hybrid CBIR-based system. Knee Osteoarthritis is the wear and tear of the cartilage in the knee joint. Knee osteoarthritis is a disease whose incidence increases, especially after a certain age. In this study, CBIR techniques were preferred to detect knee osteoarthritis. In the proposed method, feature extraction was performed using DarkNet53, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). These features are combined to leverage the benefits of different aspects of the same image. To enhance the proposed model's speed and effectiveness, a hybrid model was developed utilizing the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) method. Seven different distance measurement metrics were used in the developed CBIR model. Current deep learning architectures published in the literature struggle to achieve comparable success rates in distinguishing between closely related but distinct disease groups. The study highlights the challenges that increasing class diversity poses for the performance of deep learning architectures. In addition, the developed system aims to overcome the limitations of existing deep learning models in distinguishing similar disease groups. | 技术进步导致数据库规模迅速增长，使得定位和访问特定数据组件变得困难。虽然深度学习和其他机器学习架构在检索数据组件方面前景广阔，但其效果在处理疾病群组时更为显著。相反，当访问大型数据集时，这种效果会下降。基于内容的图像检索（CBIR）方法被用于大型数据集。在本研究中，使用开发的基于混合CBIR的系统进行了膝骨关节炎检测。膝骨关节炎是膝关节软骨的磨损。膝骨关节炎是一种发病率增加的疾病，尤其是在一定年龄后。在本研究中，优选CBIR技术来检测膝骨关节炎。在提出的方法中，使用DarkNet53、方向梯度直方图（HOG）和局部二值模式（LBP）进行特征提取。这些特征被结合起来，以利用同一图像不同方面的优势。为了提高所提出模型的速度和效果，利用邻域成分分析（NCA）方法开发了一种混合模型。在开发的CBIR模型中使用了七种不同的距离测量指标。当前文献中发表的深度学习架构在区分密切相关但不同的疾病群组时难以达到相当的成功率。该研究强调了类别多样性增加对深度学习架构性能带来的挑战。此外，开发的系统旨在克服现有深度学习模型在区分相似疾病群组方面的局限性。 | 40813877 | Medical Image Analysis |
| CBCT-based online adaptive radiotherapy of the bladder - geometrical and dosimetrical considerations compared to conventional IGRT. | 基于CBCT的膀胱在线自适应放疗——与传统IGRT相比的几何和剂量学考量。 | Fischer Jann, Fischer Laura Anna, Bensberg Jona, Bojko Natalia, Bouabdallaoui Mohamed et al. | Radiation oncology (London, England) (2025) | Bladder cancer radiotherapy presents unique challenges due to the dynamic anatomy of the bladder and the surrounding organs. Conventional image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) relies on fixed treatment margins and daily couch corrections, which can result in suboptimal dose delivery. Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)-based online adaptive radiotherapy (oART) allows daily re-optimization of treatment plans, potentially improving target dose coverage while minimizing exposure to organs at risk (OAR). This study compares oART with IGRT in bladder cancer patients. | 膀胱癌放疗因膀胱及周围器官的动态解剖结构而面临独特挑战。传统图像引导放疗（IGRT）依赖固定治疗边界和每日治疗床校正，可能导致剂量投递欠佳。基于锥形束CT（CBCT）的在线自适应放疗（oART）能每日重新优化治疗计划，有望提升靶区剂量覆盖度，同时减少危及器官（OAR）受照量。本研究对比了膀胱癌患者采用oART与IGRT的效果差异。 | 40813674 | Medical Image Analysis |

| RGB color correction and gamut limitations in smartphone-based kinetic analysis of chemical reactions. | 基于智能手机的化学反应动力学分析中的RGB色彩校正与色域限制。 | Fyfe Calum, Yu Shengkai, Zhang Jing, Reid Marc | Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry (2025) | The variability in hardware specifications and environmental factors poses significant challenges to the use of smartphone cameras in analytical measurement. Towards time-resolved color analysis and reaction monitoring, we systematically quantified multiple sources of measurement uncertainty in smartphone-based color measurements, finding that while sensor repeatability is high ( Δ E < 0.5  ), lighting conditions and viewing angles can introduce substantial bias ( Δ E  versus reference colors increasing by up to 64% at oblique angles). We implemented and evaluated a matrix-based image color correction methodology using a color reference chart, reducing inter-device and lighting-dependent variations by 65-70% (quantified by the color change metric, Δ E  ). Moving beyond static image correction to video analysis, our approach was validated through the monitoring of Blue1 dye degradation kinetics using videos recorded on two different smartphones. Time-resolved and color-corrected measurements from both devices produced consistent kinetic profiles. Importantly, we identified a fundamental limitation in RGB-based colorimetry: highly saturated colors that exceed the sRGB color gamut create artificial discontinuities in kinetic profiles, manifesting as "shouldering" effects not present in spectrophotometric data. Unlike previous methods that focused on controlling environmental factors through custom enclosures, our time-resolved color correction methodology systematically quantifies and corrects for multiple sources of color bias across various smartphone models, enabling standardized measurements even in variable conditions. This advancement enhances the reliability of field-ready, smartphone-based colorimetric applications and establishes a framework for calibrating video-based reaction monitoring against established spectroscopic measurements. | 硬件规格和环境因素的差异性给智能手机摄像头在分析测量中的应用带来了重大挑战。针对时间分辨颜色分析和反应监测，我们系统量化了基于智能手机颜色测量中的多种不确定性来源，发现虽然传感器重复性较高（ΔE < 0.5），但光照条件和视角可能引入显著偏差（与参考颜色相比，斜射角度下ΔE最高增加64%）。我们采用基于矩阵的图像颜色校正方法，通过色卡实现跨设备和光照差异的校正，将相关变异降低了65-70%（以颜色变化指标ΔE量化）。突破静态图像校正的局限，该方法在视频分析中通过两台不同智能手机记录的Blue1染料降解动力学监测得到验证。经时间分辨和颜色校正后，两台设备的测量结果呈现出一致的动力学曲线。值得注意的是，我们发现基于RGB的比色法存在根本限制：超出sRGB色域的高饱和度颜色会在动力学曲线中产生人为间断，表现为分光光度数据中不存在的"肩部效应"。与以往通过定制装置控制环境因素的方法不同，我们的时间分辨颜色校正技术系统量化并修正了不同智能手机型号间的多种颜色偏差源，实现了多变条件下的标准化测量。这一进展提升了智能手机比色法在现场应用中的可靠性，并为视频反应监测与标准光谱测量的校准建立了框架。 | 40813462 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Clinical Validation of Deep Learning for Image Restoration of Ultra-Low-Count [18F]FDG PET for Dementia Diagnostics. | 深度学习用于痴呆症诊断中超低计数[18F]FDG PET图像恢复的临床验证。 | Schiller Florian, Brumberg Joachim, Frings Lars, Deschamps Joran, Schmied Christopher et al. | Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine (2025) | Deep learning (DL) represents a promising technique for image restoration. We explored its ability to restore ultra-low-count [18F]FDG PET studies of the brain in subjects with dementia and in healthy subjects to allow for reduced scan durations or administered activities without compromising diagnostic performance. Methods: Various DL models using the content aware image restoration approach of CSBDeep toolbox (3D U-nets) were trained with subvolumes of 1,000 random subjects. On the basis of 10-min list-mode PET data after injection of 208 ± 10 MBq of [18F]FDG, we reconstructed reduced scan durations of 2 min, 1 min, 30 s, 20 s, and 10 s. The resulting models were applied to [18F]FDG PET scans of subjects with Alzheimer disease (n = 15), frontotemporal dementia (n = 14), and healthy controls (n = 13). We explored the effect of reduced scan times on individual regional measures in diagnostically relevant regions and on voxel-based group contrasts. Three independent readers rated all datasets with regard to assessability, diagnosis, and diagnostic confidence. Results: Individual mean regional [18F]FDG uptake remained largely unchanged. The SD strongly increased with shorter scan duration without application of DL (mean increase ≤ 48%), whereas it slightly decreased with DL (≥-7%). In group contrasts, the number of significant voxels strongly decreased with shorter scan time without DL (≥-41%), which was partially offset by DL (≥-27%). On visual reads, the fraction of assessable images steeply fell to only 4% (10-s scan) for scan durations below 2 min without DL, whereas every single image restored with DL was assessable. The diagnostic confidence continuously declined with shorter scan durations without DL, whereas diagnostic confidence only negligibly changed with DL (intermediate-to-high confidence ratings: 0%-54% vs. 80%-84%; 83% for the 10-min scan). The diagnostic accuracy of PET reads dropped from 90% to 4% without and remained high with DL (90%-93%; 90% for the 10-min scan). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the compelling performance of DL to restore cerebral [18F]FDG PET datasets with ultra-low-count statistics for quantitative regional, voxel-based group, and clinical visual analyses. Consequently, DL enables a dramatic reduction of scan durations or administered activities (e.g., 10-min scan with 3.5 MBq, equivalent to ∼60 µSv) for [18F]FDG PET in patients with dementia and possibly other indications. | 深度学习（DL）是一种极具前景的图像修复技术。我们探索了其在修复痴呆患者和健康受试者超低计数[18F]FDG脑部PET研究中的能力，旨在缩短扫描时间或降低给药活度的同时不影响诊断性能。方法：使用CSBDeep工具箱的内容感知图像修复方法（3D U-nets）训练了多种DL模型，训练数据来自1,000名随机受试者的子体积。基于注射208±10 MBq [18F]FDG后10分钟的列表模式PET数据，我们重建了缩短后的扫描时间：2分钟、1分钟、30秒、20秒和10秒。将所得模型应用于阿尔茨海默病（15例）、额颞叶痴呆（14例）和健康对照（13例）的[18F]FDG PET扫描。我们研究了缩短扫描时间对诊断相关区域个体区域测量值及基于体素的组间对比的影响。三位独立阅片人对所有数据集的可评估性、诊断和诊断信心进行评分。结果：个体平均区域[18F]FDG摄取基本保持不变。未应用DL时，标准差随扫描时间缩短大幅增加（平均增幅≤48%），而应用DL后略有下降（≥-7%）。组间对比中，未使用DL时显著体素数量随扫描时间缩短大幅减少（≥-41%），而DL部分抵消了这一影响（≥-27%）。视觉评估显示，未使用DL时，扫描时间低于2分钟的可评估图像比例急剧下降至仅4%（10秒扫描），而经DL修复的图像全部可评估。未使用DL时诊断信心随扫描时间缩短持续下降，而DL仅引起可忽略的变化（中高信心评分：0%-54% vs. 80%-84%；10分钟扫描为83%）。未使用DL时PET诊断准确率从90%降至4%，而使用DL后保持高位（90%-93%；10分钟扫描为90%）。结论：我们的研究证明DL在修复超低计数统计的脑部[18F]FDG PET数据集方面表现卓越，适用于定量区域分析、基于体素的组间分析和临床视觉评估。因此，DL可显著缩短痴呆患者[18F]FDG PET的扫描时间或降低给药活度（如3.5 MBq的10分钟扫描，约等效60 µSv），并可能适用于其他适应症。 | 40813236 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Addressing Partial Volume Effects in Clinical PET Quantification: Modern Correction Strategies and Challenges. | 临床PET定量中的部分容积效应应对：现代校正策略与挑战。 | Marquis Harry, Erlandsson Kjell, Buvat Irène | PET clinics (2025) | Partial volume correction (PVC) is needed for an accurate quantification in clinical PET. Novel PVC methods can be divided into 4 categories: Post-reconstruction region-based methods, returning PVC regional values, making them suitable for quantification but not visual analysis ; post-reconstruction image enhancement techniques, either based on deconvolution or on the combination in the wavelet domain of PET functional information with high resolution information ; in-reconstruction resolution modelling, by incorporating a resolution model in an iterative reconstruction algorithm combined with regularization ; and deep learning-based approaches, which are based on networks that can be trained either with simulated data, real data, or data corrected with another PVC method, or can be self-supervised. | 部分容积校正（PVC）是临床PET精确量化所必需的。新型PVC方法可分为四类：重建后基于区域的方法，返回PVC区域值，适用于量化但不适合视觉分析；重建后图像增强技术，基于去卷积或在小波域结合PET功能信息与高分辨率信息；重建过程中的分辨率建模，通过在迭代重建算法中结合分辨率模型与正则化；以及基于深度学习的方法，这些方法依赖于可通过模拟数据、真实数据、经其他PVC方法校正的数据进行训练的网络，或采用自监督学习。 | 40813150 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Advanced Feature Extraction and Outlier Detection for 3D Biological/Biomedical Image Registration. | 高级特征提取与异常值检测在三维生物/生物医学图像配准中的应用。 | Hamzehei Sahand, Bai Jun, Raimondi Gianna, Tripp Rebecca, Ostroff Linnaea et al. | IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics (2025) | 3D image registration is essential in computer vision, medical imaging, and robotics. By aligning images from different perspectives into a single coordinate system, this approach provides a consistent viewpoint for analysis. Using accurate image alignment, we may compare, evaluate, and integrate data from different contexts. This paper describes a new method to register 3D or z-stack microscopy and medical image. It uses a hybrid of traditional and deep learning methods for feature extraction and adaptive likelihood-based methods for finding outliers. The proposed method uses the Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and the Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50) to extract effective features to obtain precise and accurate representations of image contents. The registration approach also relies on the adaptive Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple Consensus (MLESAC) method, which optimizes outlier detection and increases noise and distortion resistance to improve the efficacy of these combined extracted features. This concatenation approach demonstrates robustness, flexibility, and adaptability across a variety of imaging modalities, enabling the registration of complex images with higher precision. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms commonly used registration methods, including SIFT, KAZE, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB), and also registration software tools such as bUnwarpJ, and TurboReg. The algorithm's effectiveness is evaluated in terms of Mutual Information (MI), Phase Congruency-Based (PCB), and Gradient-Based Metrics (GBM). These metrics are applied to two types of datasets, including a brain scan dataset and 3D serial sections of multiplex microscopy image datasets. | 三维图像配准在计算机视觉、医学成像和机器人技术中至关重要。该方法通过将不同视角的图像对齐到同一坐标系中，为分析提供一致的观察基准。借助精确的图像对齐，我们能够对不同来源的数据进行比较、评估与整合。本文提出了一种针对三维或Z轴堆叠显微图像与医学图像的新型配准方法，该方法融合传统技术与深度学习进行特征提取，并采用基于自适应似然估计的离群值检测机制。所提出的方法结合尺度不变特征变换（SIFT）与50层残差网络（ResNet50）来提取有效特征，从而获得精确的图像内容表征。该配准方案还采用自适应最大似然估计样本一致性（MLESAC）算法优化离群点检测，增强对噪声和畸变的鲁棒性，以提升复合特征的配准效能。这种串联式方法展现出跨成像模态的强健性、灵活性和适应性，能够以更高精度实现复杂图像的配准。实验结果表明，该算法在配准性能上优于SIFT、KAZE、ORB等常规方法以及bUnwarpJ、TurboReg等配准软件工具。通过互信息（MI）、相位一致性（PCB）和梯度度量（GBM）三项指标对算法效果进行评估，测试数据集包含脑部扫描影像和多重显微成像三维连续切片两类数据。 | 40811303 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Lung-DDPM: Semantic Layout-guided Diffusion Models for Thoracic CT Image Synthesis. | Lung-DDPM：基于语义布局引导的胸部CT图像合成扩散模型。 | Jiang Yifan, Lemarechal Yannick, Bafaro Josee, Abi-Rjeile Jessica, Joubert Philippe et al. | IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering (2025) | With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4×, 3.1×, and 29.5× better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a Dice Coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8% and 18.6% improvements in Dice and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.

Nevertheless, most qMRI methods are time-consuming and sensitive to motion, making them inadequate for quantifying organs with physiological movement. In this context, single-shot multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) imaging technique has been presented, but its acquisition efficiency and image quality are limited when the field of view (FOV) is smaller than the object, especially for abdominal organs and myocardium. | 定量磁共振成像（qMRI）因其能够无创表征组织特性，在临床诊断和医学领域受到越来越多的关注。然而，大多数qMRI方法耗时且对运动敏感，使其难以量化具有生理运动的器官。在此背景下，单次多重叠回波分离（MOLED）成像技术被提出，但当视野（FOV）小于目标物体时，其采集效率和图像质量会受到限制，尤其对于腹部器官和心肌而言更是如此。 | 40811296 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Head-to-Head Comparison between MRI and CT in the Evaluation of Volume and Quality of Epicardial Adipose Tissue. | MRI与CT在评估心外膜脂肪组织体积和质量中的直接对比。 | Firouznia Marjan, Molnar David, Edin Carl, Hjelmgren Ola, Östgren Carl-Johan et al. | Radiology. Cardiothoracic imaging (2025) | Purpose To systematically compare MRI- and CT-based measurements of both the volume and quality of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT). Materials and Methods This prospective study included participants from a subset of the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) who underwent MRI and CT between November 2017 and July 2018. Dixon fat-water separation MR images were manually segmented, and a threshold-based approach based on a fat signal fraction (FSF) map was used to obtain the EAT volume. Within this EAT volume, the mean FSF was quantified as a measure of fat quality. EAT segmentation from CT images was performed using deep learning techniques, and the EAT volume and its mean attenuation were quantified. Correlation between MRI- and CT-based measurements of EAT volume and quality was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Ninety-two participants (mean age, 59 years ± 5 [SD]; 60 male participants) were included. The intermodality correlation for EAT volume was very strong (r = 0.92, P < .001), with systematically larger values for CT versus MRI (P < .001). There was a strong negative correlation between MRI FSF and CT attenuation (r = -0.72, P < .001). Repeatability analysis for assessment of MRI EAT volume showed good interreader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.86) and excellent intrareader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.96). Conclusion Correlation between MRI and CT was very strong for EAT volume and strong for EAT quality.

| Early Diagnosis of Knee Osteoarthritis With a Natural Language Processing-Driven Approach Based on Clinician Notes: Development and Validation Study. | 基于临床医生笔记的自然语言处理方法在膝骨关节炎早期诊断中的开发与验证研究。 | Thanyakunsajja Narathip, Jitkajornwanich Kulsawasd, Xu Shan, Shin Donghee, Charoenporn Pattama | JMIR formative research (2025) | Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common form of knee arthritis that can cause significant disability and affect a patient's quality of life. Although this disease is chronic and irreversible, the patient's condition can be improved and the progression of the disease can be prevented if the disease is diagnosed early and the patient receives appropriate treatment immediately. Therefore, the prediction of knee OA is considered one of the essential steps to effectively diagnose and prevent further severe OA conditions. Knee OA is commonly diagnosed by medical experts or physicians, and the diagnosis of OA is mainly based on patients' laboratory results and medical images, including x-ray and magnetic resonance images. However, diagnosis through such data is often time-consuming. Moreover, the diagnosis results can vary among physicians depending on their expertise. Previous studies mostly focused on using approaches, such as those involving artificial intelligence, to automatically detect knee OA through such data. However, these studies did not incorporate clinicians' or doctors' notes (text data) into the analysis, although these data involving reported symptoms and behaviors are already available and easier to collect and access than laboratory data and image data. | 膝骨关节炎（OA）是一种常见的膝关节炎症，可导致严重功能障碍并影响患者生活质量。尽管该疾病具有慢性且不可逆的特性，但若能早期诊断并及时给予适当治疗，患者的病情可得到改善，疾病进展也能被延缓。因此，预测膝骨关节炎被视为有效诊断和预防病情恶化的关键步骤之一。目前膝骨关节炎主要由医学专家或医师通过患者的实验室检查结果和医学影像（包括X光片和磁共振图像）进行诊断，但此类数据的诊断过程通常耗时较长，且结果可能因医师专业水平不同而存在差异。既往研究多集中于利用人工智能等方法通过此类数据自动检测膝骨关节炎，但这些研究均未将临床医生记录的文本数据（如患者主诉症状和行为）纳入分析——尽管这类数据更易获取且实际诊疗中已常规采集。 | 40810448 | Medical Image Analysis |

This review provides an overview of current and emerging AI applications, from risk assessment and early detection to treatment and supportive care. AI-driven tools are being developed to integrate diverse data sources, including multi-omics and electronic health records, to improve cancer risk stratification and personalize prevention strategies. In screening and diagnosis, AI algorithms show promise in augmenting the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis and histopathology interpretation. AI also offers opportunities to refine treatment planning, optimize radiation therapy, and personalize systemic therapy selection. Furthermore, AI is explored for its potential to improve survivorship care by tailoring interventions and to enhance end-of-life care through improved symptom management and prognostic modeling. Beyond care delivery, AI augments clinical workflows, streamlines the dissemination of up-to-date evidence, and captures critical patient-reported outcomes for clinical decision support and outcomes assessment. However, the successful integration of AI into clinical practice requires addressing key challenges, including rigorous validation of algorithms, ensuring data privacy and security, and mitigating potential biases. Effective implementation necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration and comprehensive education for health care professionals. The synergistic interaction between AI and clinical expertise is crucial for realizing the potential of AI to contribute to personalized and effective cancer care. This review highlights the current state of AI in oncology and underscores the importance of responsible development and implementation. | 人工智能（AI）在提升肿瘤学多个环节方面具有显著潜力，涵盖癌症诊疗全周期。本综述概述了AI从风险评估、早期检测到治疗和支持性护理等当前与新兴应用。AI驱动工具正被开发用于整合多组学和电子健康记录等多元数据源，以优化癌症风险分层并实现个体化预防策略。在筛查与诊断领域，AI算法有望提高医学影像分析和病理学解读的准确性与效率。AI还能优化治疗计划设计、精确放射治疗并协助个体化全身治疗方案选择。此外，AI正被探索用于通过定制化干预改善生存期护理，以及通过优化症状管理和预后模型提升临终关怀质量。在诊疗服务之外，AI可增强临床工作流程，促进最新证据传播，并采集关键患者报告结局以支持临床决策和疗效评估。然而，AI成功融入临床实践需解决关键挑战，包括算法严格验证、确保数据隐私安全及减少潜在偏倚。有效实施需要跨学科协作和对医护人员的全面培训。AI与临床专业知识的协同作用对实现个性化高效癌症诊疗至关重要。本综述阐明了AI在肿瘤学领域的现状，并强调了负责任开发与实施的重要性。 | 40810209 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Surgical Innovations in Otolaryngology: A Critical Analysis of Emerging Techniques and Technologies. | 耳鼻喉科手术创新：新兴技术与方法的批判性分析。 | Naqvi Bushra, Ameen Samreen, Batool Syeda Wajiha, Riaz Maryum, Umer Muhammad Rizwan et al. | Cureus (2025) | Introduction An evaluation of new methods of surgery in otolaryngology is done with emphasis on four advanced surgical techniques: transoral robotic surgery (TORS), image-guided sinus surgery (IGSS), endoscopic skull base surgery, and 3D-printed implant-assisted procedures. The study evaluated a sample of 300 patients from Pakistan, ensuring that the evaluation was done in the light of these technologies vis-à-vis traditional ones. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of such surgical innovations in terms of quality of life (QoL), complication rates, follow-up compliance, and intra-operative parameters. In addition, this study aimed to identify predictors for postoperative complications, thereby profiling potential selection biases for using these advanced techniques in surgical interventions. Methodology A retrospective cohort analysis of 300 patients was conducted, including demographic variables, clinical events, tumor volumes, and comorbidities according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index and frailty scores. Assessment of postoperative outcome parameters included QoL, complication events, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. A random forest model was trained to predict postoperative complications and showed an accuracy of 86.7% with an AUC-ROC of 0.91. Results The TORS and 3D-printed implant groups performed much better, showing significantly higher QoL scores (84.3 and 82.5 on average), low complication rates (9.7% and 6.8%), and high follow-up compliance (87% and 84%). They also show less blood loss and less time in ICUs. However, far fewer comorbidities and smaller tumors were found in these patients, which points toward a selection bias. Conclusion Emerging surgical innovations in otolaryngology, such as TORS and 3D-printed implants, create remarkable benefits in clinical scenarios associated with QoL and complications. However, patient selection bias creates barriers to realizing equitable access to the technologies, creating space for argumentation about evidence-based practice in clinical decision-making. | 引言  <br>对耳鼻喉科新型手术方法的评估聚焦于四项先进技术：经口机器人手术（TORS）、影像引导鼻窦手术（IGSS）、内镜颅底手术和3D打印植入物辅助手术。研究选取巴基斯坦300例患者样本，结合传统技术对比评估这些技术的效果。  <br><br>研究目标  <br>本研究旨在从生活质量（QoL）、并发症发生率、随访依从性和术中参数等方面评估手术创新的影响，并识别术后并发症的预测因素，从而揭示使用这些先进技术时潜在的选择偏倚。  <br><br>方法学  <br>对300例患者进行回顾性队列分析，收集人口统计学变量、临床事件、肿瘤体积、查尔森合并症指数及衰弱评分等数据。术后结果评估包括QoL、并发症事件和重症监护室（ICU）停留时间。采用随机森林模型预测术后并发症，准确率达86.7%，AUC-ROC为0.91。  <br><br>结果  <br>TORS和3D打印植入物组表现更优：平均QoL评分显著更高（分别为84.3和82.5）、并发症发生率更低（9.7%和6.8%）、随访依从性更高（87%和84%），且术中失血量更少、ICU停留时间更短。但这些患者合并症较少、肿瘤较小，提示存在选择偏倚。  <br><br>结论  <br>TORS和3D打印植入物等耳鼻喉科新兴手术技术显著改善了患者生活质量和并发症情况，但患者选择偏倚阻碍了技术的公平应用，需在临床决策中进一步探讨循证实践。 | 40809627 | Medical Image Analysis |

However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning-driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms. | 从航拍图像中精确分析车辆信息对于智能交通管理、城市规划、自主导航及军事监视等新兴技术与公共服务应用日益关键。然而，分析无人机拍摄视频存在若干固有挑战：目标车辆尺寸小、遮挡、杂乱的城市背景、运动模糊以及光线条件波动，这些问题制约了传统感知系统的准确性与稳定性。针对这些复杂问题，本研究提出一套专为无人机交通监控优化的端到端深度学习感知流程。该框架整合了多个先进模块：采用RetinexNet进行图像预处理，利用HRNet进行分割以保持高分辨率语义信息，基于YOLOv11框架实现车辆检测。通过Deep SORT算法实现高效车辆追踪，CSRNet网络处理高密度车流计数。LSTM网络被集成用于基于时序模式的车辆轨迹预测，结合DenseNet与SuperPoint实现鲁棒特征提取。最终采用视觉Transformer（ViT）进行分类，利用注意力机制确保跨类别精准识别。这种模块化统一架构专为处理时空动态设计，可适配多种无人机平台的实时部署需求。 | 40809070 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Dual-Path Adversarial Denoising Network Based on UNet. | 基于UNet的双路径对抗去噪网络。 | Yu Jinchi, Zhou Yu, Sun Mingchen, Wang Dadong | Sensors (Basel, Switzerland) (2025) | Digital image quality is crucial for reliable analysis in applications such as medical imaging, satellite remote sensing, and video surveillance. However, traditional denoising methods struggle to balance noise removal with detail preservation and lack adaptability to various types of noise. We propose a novel three-module architecture for image denoising, comprising a generator, a dual-path-UNet-based denoiser, and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic noise patterns to augment training data, while the dual-path-UNet denoiser uses multiple receptive field modules to preserve fine details and dense feature fusion to maintain global structural integrity. The discriminator provides adversarial feedback to enhance denoising performance. This dual-path adversarial training mechanism addresses the limitations of traditional methods by simultaneously capturing both local details and global structures. Experiments on the SIDD, DND, and PolyU datasets demonstrate superior performance. We compare our architecture with the latest state-of-the-art GAN variants through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. These results confirm the effectiveness of noise removal with minimal loss of critical image details. The proposed architecture enhances image denoising capabilities in complex noise scenarios, providing a robust solution for applications that require high image fidelity. By enhancing adaptability to various types of noise while maintaining structural integrity, this method provides a versatile tool for image processing tasks that require preserving detail. | 数字图像质量对于医学影像、卫星遥感和视频监控等应用中的可靠分析至关重要。然而传统去噪方法难以平衡噪声消除与细节保留，且缺乏对不同噪声类型的适应性。我们提出了一种新型三模块图像去噪架构，包含生成器、基于双路径UNet的去噪器和判别器。生成器合成噪声模式以增强训练数据，双路径UNet通过多感受野模块保留精细细节，并采用密集特征融合保持全局结构完整性。判别器提供对抗性反馈以提升去噪性能。这种双路径对抗训练机制通过同步捕捉局部细节与全局结构，解决了传统方法的局限性。在SIDD、DND和PolyU数据集上的实验证明了其优越性能。我们通过定性与定量评估，将该架构与最先进的GAN变体进行全面对比，结果证实其在关键图像细节损失最小化的前提下实现了高效去噪。该架构提升了复杂噪声场景下的图像去噪能力，为需要高保真图像的应用提供了稳健解决方案。通过增强对各类噪声的适应性并保持结构完整性，该方法为需要保留细节的图像处理任务提供了通用工具。 | 40807920 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Highly Accelerated Dual-Pose Medical Image Registration via Improved Differential Evolution. | 基于改进差分演化的高速双姿态医学图像配准。 | Zhou Dibin, Xing Fengyuan, Liu Wenhao, Liu Fuchang | Sensors (Basel, Switzerland) (2025) | Medical image registration is an indispensable preprocessing step to align medical images to a common coordinate system before in-depth analysis. The registration precision is critical to the following analysis. In addition to representative image features, the initial pose settings and multiple poses in images will significantly affect the registration precision, which is largely neglected in state-of-the-art works. To address this, the paper proposes a dual-pose medical image registration algorithm based on improved differential evolution. More specifically, the proposed algorithm defines a composite similarity measurement based on contour points and utilizes this measurement to calculate the similarity between frontal-lateral positional DRR (Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph) images and X-ray images. In order to ensure the accuracy of the registration algorithm in particular dimensions, the algorithm implements a dual-pose registration strategy. A PDE (Phased Differential Evolution) algorithm is proposed for iterative optimization, enhancing the optimization algorithm's ability to globally search in low-dimensional space, aiding in the discovery of global optimal solutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate similarity metrics compared to conventional registration algorithms; the dual-pose registration strategy largely reduces errors in specific dimensions, resulting in reductions of 67.04% and 71.84%, respectively, in rotation and translation errors. Additionally, the algorithm is more suitable for clinical applications due to its lower complexity. | 医学图像配准是将医学图像对齐至统一坐标系的关键预处理步骤，其精度直接影响后续分析质量。除典型图像特征外，初始位姿设置与图像中的多体位因素会显著影响配准精度，这一关键问题在当前主流研究中常被忽视。为此，本文提出基于改进差分进化的双体位医学图像配准算法。该算法通过定义基于轮廓点的复合相似性度量，计算正侧位DRR图像与X射线图像的相似度。为确保配准算法在特定维度上的准确性，采用双体位配准策略，并提出PDE分阶段差分进化算法进行迭代优化，增强优化算法在低维空间的全局搜索能力以发现全局最优解。大量实验表明：相比传统配准算法，本算法能提供更精确的相似性度量；双体位策略使特定维度误差大幅降低，旋转误差和平移误差分别减少67.04%和71.84%；同时算法复杂度更低，更具临床适用性。 | 40807770 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Segmentation-Assisted Fusion-Based Classification for Automated CXR Image Analysis. | 基于分割辅助融合的自动化胸部X光图像分类方法。 | Kang Shilu, Li Dongfang, Xu Jiaxin, Mei Aokun, Huo Hua | Sensors (Basel, Switzerland) (2025) | Accurate classification of chest X-ray (CXR) images is crucial for diagnosing lung diseases in medical imaging. Existing deep learning models for CXR image classification face challenges in distinguishing non-lung features. In this work, we propose a new segmentation-assisted fusion-based classification method. The method involves two stages: first, we use a lightweight segmentation model, Partial Convolutional Segmentation Network (PCSNet) designed based on an encoder-decoder architecture, to accurately obtain lung masks from CXR images. Then, a fusion of the masked CXR image with the original image enables classification using the improved lightweight ShuffleNetV2 model. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on segmentation datasets including the Montgomery County Dataset (MC) and Shenzhen Hospital Dataset (SH), and classification datasets such as Chest X-Ray Images for Pneumonia (CXIP) and COVIDx. Compared with seven segmentation models (U-Net, Attention-Net, SegNet, FPNNet, DANet, DMNet, and SETR), five classification models (ResNet34, ResNet50, DenseNet121, Swin-Transforms, and ShuffleNetV2), and state-of-the-art methods, our PCSNet model achieved high segmentation performance on CXR images. Compared to the state-of-the-art Attention-Net model, the accuracy of PCSNet increased by 0.19% (98.94% vs. 98.75%), and the boundary accuracy improved by 0.3% (97.86% vs. 97.56%), while requiring 62% fewer parameters. For pneumonia classification using the CXIP dataset, the proposed strategy outperforms the current best model by 0.14% in accuracy (98.55% vs. 98.41%). For COVID-19 classification with the COVIDx dataset, the model reached an accuracy of 97.50%, the absolute improvement in accuracy compared to CovXNet was 0.1%, and clinical metrics demonstrate more significant gains: specificity increased from 94.7% to 99.5%. These results highlight the model's effectiveness in medical image analysis, demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. | 胸部X光（CXR）图像的准确分类对医学影像中肺部疾病的诊断至关重要。现有用于CXR图像分类的深度学习模型在区分非肺部特征方面面临挑战。本研究提出了一种新的基于分割辅助融合的分类方法。该方法分为两个阶段：首先，我们采用基于编码器-解码器架构设计的轻量级分割模型PCSNet，从CXR图像中精确获取肺部掩膜；随后通过掩膜图像与原图的融合，利用改进的轻量级ShuffleNetV2模型进行分类。所提方法在包括蒙哥马利县数据集（MC）和深圳医院数据集（SH）的分割数据集，以及肺炎胸部X光图像（CXIP）和COVIDx等分类数据集上进行了训练与评估。与七种分割模型（U-Net、Attention-Net、SegNet、FPNNet、DANet、DMNet和SETR）、五种分类模型（ResNet34、ResNet50、DenseNet121、Swin-Transforms和ShuffleNetV2）及现有最优方法相比，我们的PCSNet模型在CXR图像上实现了高水平分割性能。相较于最优的Attention-Net模型，PCSNet准确率提升0.19%（98.94%对98.75%），边界精度提高0.3%（97.86%对97.56%），同时参数需求减少62%。在CXIP数据集肺炎分类任务中，所提策略以98.55%的准确率超越当前最佳模型0.14%；在COVIDx数据集的新冠分类任务中，模型准确率达97.50%，较CovXNet绝对提升0.1%，临床指标提升更为显著：特异性从94.7%提升至99.5%。这些结果凸显了该模型在医学图像分析中的有效性，相比现有最优方法实现了具有临床意义的改进。 | 40807746 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Improving Endodontic Radiograph Interpretation with TV-CLAHE for Enhanced Root Canal Detection. | 利用TV-CLAHE技术提升牙科X光片解析能力以优化根管检测效果。 | Obuchowicz Barbara, Zarzecka Joanna, Strzelecki Michał, Jakubowska Marzena, Obuchowicz Rafał et al. | Journal of clinical medicine (2025) | Objective: The accurate visualization of root canal systems on periapical radiographs is critical for successful endodontic treatment. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of several image enhancement algorithms-including a novel Total Variation-Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (TV-CLAHE) technique-in improving the detectability of root canal configurations in mandibular incisors, using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) as the gold standard. A null hypothesis was tested, assuming that enhancement methods would not significantly improve root canal detection compared to original radiographs. Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 periapical radiographs of mandibular incisors, resulting in 420 images after applying seven enhancement techniques: Histogram Equalization (HE), Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), CLAHE optimized with Pelican Optimization Algorithm (CLAHE-POA), Global CLAHE (G-CLAHE), k-Caputo Fractional Differential Operator (KCFDO), and the proposed TV-CLAHE. Four experienced observers (two radiologists and two dentists) independently assessed root canal visibility. Subjective evaluation was performed using an own scale inspired by a 5-point Likert scale, and the detection accuracy was compared to the CBCT findings. Quantitative metrics including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), image entropy, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) were calculated to objectively assess image quality. Results: Root canal detection accuracy improved across all enhancement methods, with the proposed TV-CLAHE algorithm achieving the highest performance (93-98% accuracy), closely approaching CBCT-level visualization. G-CLAHE also showed substantial improvement (up to 92%). Statistical analysis confirmed significant inter-method differences (p < 0.001). TV-CLAHE outperformed all other techniques in subjective quality ratings and yielded superior SNR and entropy values. Conclusions: Advanced image enhancement methods, particularly TV-CLAHE, significantly improve root canal visibility in 2D radiographs and offer a practical, low-cost alternative to CBCT in routine dental diagnostics. These findings support the integration of optimized contrast enhancement techniques into endodontic imaging workflows to reduce the risk of missed canals and improve treatment outcomes. | 目的：根尖周X线片上根管系统的准确可视化对成功进行牙髓治疗至关重要。本研究旨在以锥形束计算机断层扫描（CBCT）为金标准，评估比较多种图像增强算法（包括新型全变分-对比度受限自适应直方图均衡化技术TV-CLAHE）在提升下颌切牙根管构型可检出性方面的效果。检验的零假设为：与传统X线片相比，增强方法不会显著改善根管检出率。方法：对60张下颌切牙根尖周片进行回顾性分析，应用7种增强技术（直方图均衡化HE、对比度受限自适应直方图均衡化CLAHE、鹈鹕优化算法优化的CLAHE-POA、全局CLAHE、k-Caputo分数阶微分算子KCFDO及提出的TV-CLAHE）生成420幅图像。4名经验丰富的观察者（2名放射科医师和2名牙医）独立评估根管可见度，采用基于5级李克特量表的自定义量表进行主观评价，并将检出准确性与CBCT结果对比。通过峰值信噪比PSNR、信噪比SNR、图像熵和结构相似性指数SSIM等定量指标客观评估图像质量。结果：所有增强方法均提高了根管检出准确率，其中TV-CLAHE算法表现最佳（93-98%准确率），最接近CBCT的显像水平。G-CLAHE也显示出显著改善（最高达92%）。统计分析证实方法间存在显著差异（p<0.001）。TV-CLAHE在主观质量评分中优于其他技术，并具有更高的SNR和熵值。结论：先进图像增强方法（特别是TV-CLAHE）能显著提升二维X线片的根管可视性，为常规牙科诊断提供了一种实用、低成本的CBCT替代方案。这些发现支持将优化对比度增强技术整合至牙髓影像工作流程，以降低遗漏根管风险并改善治疗效果。 | 40807175 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Added Value of SPECT/CT in Radio-Guided Occult Localization (ROLL) of Non-Palpable Pulmonary Nodules Treated with Uniportal Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy. | SPECT/CT在单孔视频辅助胸腔镜治疗不可触及肺结节放射引导隐匿定位（ROLL）中的附加价值。 | Aricò Demetrio, Motta Lucia, Giacoppo Giulia, Bambaci Michelangelo, Macrì Paolo et al. | Journal of clinical medicine (2025) | Background/Objectives: The extensive use of computed tomography (CT) has led to a significant increase in the detection of small and non-palpable pulmonary nodules, necessitating the use of invasive methods for definitive diagnosis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become the preferred procedure for nodule resections; however, intraoperative localization remains challenging, especially for deep or subsolid lesions. This study explores whether SPECT/CT improves the technical and clinical outcomes of radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL) before uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (u-VATS). Methods: This is a retrospective study involving consecutive patients referred for the resection of pulmonary nodules who underwent CT-guided ROLL followed by u-VATS between September 2017 and December 2024. From January 2023, SPECT/CT was systematically added after planar imaging. The cohort was divided into a planar group and a planar + SPECT/CT group. The inclusion criteria involved nodules sized ≤ 2 cm, with ground glass or solid characteristics, located at a depth of <6 cm from the pleural surface. 99mTc-MAA injected activity, timing, the classification of planar and SPECT/CT image findings (focal uptake, multisite with focal uptake, multisite without focal uptake), spillage, and post-procedure complications were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed, with continuous data expressed as the median and categorical data as the number. Comparisons were made using chi-square tests for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for procedural duration. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated to assess agreement between imaging modalities. Results: In total, 125 patients were selected for CT-guided radiotracer injection followed by uniportal-VATS. The planar group and planar + SPECT/CT group comprised 60 and 65 patients, respectively. Focal uptake was detected in 68 (54%), multisite with focal uptake in 46 (36.8%), and multisite without focal uptake in 11 patients (8.8%). In comparative analyses between planar and SPECT/CT imaging in 65 patients, 91% exhibited focal uptake, revealing significant differences in classification for 40% of the patients. SPECT/CT corrected the classification of 23 patients initially categorized as multisite with focal uptake to focal uptake, improving localization accuracy. The mean procedure duration was 39 min with SPECT/CT. Pneumothorax was more frequently detected with SPECT/CT (43% vs. 1.6%). The intraoperative localization success rate was 96%. Conclusions: SPECT/CT imaging in the ROLL procedure for detecting pulmonary nodules before u-VATs demonstrates a significant advantage in reclassifying radiotracer positioning compared to planar imaging. Considering its limited impact on surgical success rates and additional procedural time, SPECT/CT should be reserved for technically challenging cases. Larger sample sizes, multicentric and prospective randomized studies, and formal cost-utility analyses are warranted. | 背景/目的：计算机断层扫描（CT）的广泛应用导致小型且不可触及的肺结节检出率显著增加，这需要通过侵入性方法进行明确诊断。视频辅助胸腔镜手术（VATS）已成为结节切除的首选术式，但术中定位仍具挑战性，尤其是对于深部或亚实性病变。本研究探讨单孔视频辅助胸腔镜手术（u-VATS）前，SPECT/CT是否能提高放射性引导隐匿病灶定位（ROLL）的技术与临床效果。方法：这项回顾性研究纳入2017年9月至2024年12月期间连续接受CT引导ROLL后行u-VATS的肺结节切除患者。自2023年1月起，平面成像后系统性增加SPECT/CT检查。队列分为平面组和平面+SPECT/CT组。纳入标准为≤2 cm的磨玻璃或实性结节，距胸膜表面深度<6 cm。评估指标包括99mTc-MAA注射活度、时间、平面与SPECT/CT图像表现分类（局灶性摄取、多灶伴局灶性摄取、多灶无局灶性摄取）、外渗及术后并发症。统计分析采用中位数表示连续变量，频数表示分类变量，分类变量比较使用卡方检验，操作时长比较采用Mann-Whitney U检验，并通过Cohen's kappa系数评估成像方式间一致性。结果：共125例患者接受CT引导放射性示踪剂注射后行单孔VATS，平面组60例，平面+SPECT/CT组65例。54%（68例）表现为局灶性摄取，36.8%（46例）为多灶伴局灶性摄取，8.8%（11例）为多灶无局灶性摄取。65例患者中平面与SPECT/CT对比显示，91%存在局灶性摄取，40%患者分类存在显著差异。SPECT/CT将23例初始归类为"多灶伴局灶性摄取"修正为"局灶性摄取"，提升定位准确性。SPECT/CT平均操作时长39分钟，其气胸检出率更高（43% vs. 1.6%）。术中定位成功率达96%。结论：在u-VATS术前ROLL程序中，SPECT/CT在重分类示踪剂定位方面较平面成像具有显著优势。鉴于其对手术成功率影响有限且增加操作时间，建议仅用于技术难度较高的病例。未来需更大样本量、多中心前瞻性随机研究及正式成本效益分析加以验证。 | 40806959 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Automated Segmentation and Morphometric Analysis of Thioflavin-S-Stained Amyloid Deposits in Alzheimer's Disease Brains and Age-Matched Controls Using Weakly Supervised Deep Learning. | 使用弱监督深度学习对阿尔茨海默病大脑及年龄匹配对照中硫磺素-S染色的淀粉样蛋白沉积进行自动分割和形态计量分析。 | Barczánfalvi Gábor, Nyári Tibor, Tolnai József, Tiszlavicz László, Gulyás Balázs et al. | International journal of molecular sciences (2025) | Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, whose quantification plays a central role in understanding disease progression. Automated segmentation of Aβ deposits in histopathological micrographs enables large-scale analyses but is hindered by the high cost of detailed pixel-level annotations. Weakly supervised learning offers a promising alternative by leveraging coarse or indirect labels to reduce the annotation burden. We evaluated a weakly supervised approach to segment and analyze thioflavin-S-positive parenchymal amyloid pathology in AD and age-matched brains. Our pipeline integrates three key components, each designed to operate under weak supervision. First, robust preprocessing (including retrospective multi-image illumination correction and gradient-based background estimation) was applied to enhance image fidelity and support training, as models rely more on image features. Second, class activation maps (CAMs), generated by a compact deep classifier SqueezeNet, were used to identify, and coarsely localize amyloid-rich parenchymal regions from patch-wise image labels, serving as spatial priors for subsequent refinement without requiring dense pixel-level annotations. Third, a patch-based convolutional neural network, U-Net, was trained on synthetic data generated from micrographs based on CAM-derived pseudo-labels via an extensive object-level augmentation strategy, enabling refined whole-image semantic segmentation and generalization across diverse spatial configurations. To ensure robustness and unbiased evaluation, we assessed the segmentation performance of the entire framework using patient-wise group k-fold cross-validation, explicitly modeling generalization across unseen individuals, critical in clinical scenarios. Despite relying on weak labels, the integrated pipeline achieved strong segmentation performance with an average Dice similarity coefficient (≈0.763) and Jaccard index (≈0.639), widely accepted metrics for assessing segmentation quality in medical image analysis. The resulting segmentations were also visually coherent, demonstrating that weakly supervised segmentation is a viable alternative in histopathology, where acquiring dense annotations is prohibitively labor-intensive and time-consuming. Subsequent morphometric analyses on automatically segmented Aβ deposits revealed size-, structural complexity-, and global geometry-related differences across brain regions and cognitive status. These findings confirm that deposit architecture exhibits region-specific patterns and reflects underlying neurodegenerative processes, thereby highlighting the biological relevance and practical applicability of the proposed image-processing pipeline for morphometric analysis. | 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的特征是β-淀粉样蛋白（Aβ）斑块的积累，其定量分析对理解疾病进展至关重要。组织病理学显微图像中Aβ沉积的自动分割可实现大规模分析，但精细的像素级标注成本高昂。弱监督学习通过利用粗略或间接标签减轻标注负担，提供了有前景的替代方案。我们评估了一种弱监督方法，用于分割和分析AD及同龄对照脑组织中的硫磺素S阳性实质淀粉样病变。该流程整合了三个关键组件，均设计为在弱监督下运行：首先，采用稳健的预处理（包括回顾性多图像光照校正和基于梯度的背景估计）以增强图像保真度，由于模型更依赖图像特征，这为训练提供了支持；其次，通过紧凑型深度分类器SqueezeNet生成类别激活图（CAMs），从图像块标签中识别并粗定位淀粉样蛋白富集的实质区域，作为空间先验信息用于后续细化，而无需密集像素级标注；第三，基于CAM生成的伪标签，通过全面的对象级增强策略从显微图像合成数据，训练基于图像块的卷积神经网络U-Net，实现精细的全图像语义分割及对不同空间构型的泛化。为确保稳健性和无偏评估，我们采用患者分组的k折交叉验证评估整个框架的分割性能，明确模拟临床场景中跨未见个体的泛化能力。尽管依赖弱标签，该集成流程仍实现了强劲的分割性能，平均Dice相似系数（≈0.763）和Jaccard指数（≈0.639）——这两个医学图像分析中广泛认可的分割质量评估指标。所得分割结果在视觉上也具有连贯性，证明在获取密集标注极其耗时费力的组织病理学领域，弱监督分割是可行替代方案。对自动分割的Aβ沉积进行的后续形态计量分析揭示了不同脑区和认知状态间在尺寸、结构复杂性和全局几何特征上的差异。这些发现证实沉积结构呈现区域特异性模式，并反映潜在的神经退行性过程，从而凸显了所提图像处理流程在形态计量分析中的生物学相关性和实际适用性。 | 40806269 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Recurrence Patterns, Treatment Outcomes, and Prognostic Factors of Thymic Carcinoma: A Multicenter Study. | 胸腺癌的复发模式、治疗结果及预后因素：一项多中心研究。 | Tomita Natsuo, Ishihara Shunichi, Nomoto Yoshihito, Takada Akinori, Nakamura Katsumasa et al. | Cancers (2025) | Objectives: This multicenter study aimed to clarify the recurrence patterns; treatment outcomes; and prognostic factors of thymic carcinoma, a rare cancer. Methods: We analyzed 101 patients with thymic carcinoma who underwent multidisciplinary treatment, including radiotherapy. The median age was 62 years, with 27 patients in stage I-II; 44 in stage III; and 30 in stage IV by the TNM classification. Seventy-two patients underwent surgery with radiotherapy; and 29 patients underwent definitive radiotherapy. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and elective nodal irradiation (ENI) were used for 35 and 23 patients, respectively. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS); progression-free survival (PFS); and overall survival (OS) were calculated, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: With a median follow-up of 68 months, we observed 17 local recurrences; 27 regional recurrences; and 35 distant metastases. The 5-year LRFS; PFS; and OS were 82%, 41%, and 76%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that stage was the only factor associated with LRFS; PFS; and OS (p = 0.040; p < 0.0001; and p = 0.048, respectively), while treatment modality was associated with only LRFS (p = 0.015). IGRT and ENI were also associated with LRFS (p = 0.002 and 0.013, respectively). PFS and OS of stage IV patients were comparable between the surgery with radiotherapy and definitive radiotherapy groups (p = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of stage-specific treatment strategies rather than resectability, especially for stage IV patients. These results should be validated in a prospective study. Our results also suggest that radiotherapy methods influence recurrence. | 目的：这项多中心研究旨在阐明罕见癌症——胸腺癌的复发模式、治疗结果及预后因素。方法：我们分析了101例接受放疗等多学科治疗的胸腺癌患者。中位年龄62岁，按TNM分期：Ⅰ-Ⅱ期27例、Ⅲ期44例、Ⅳ期30例。72例患者接受手术联合放疗，29例接受根治性放疗。分别有35例和23例患者采用图像引导放疗（IGRT）和选择性淋巴结照射（ENI）。计算局部无复发生存期（LRFS）、无进展生存期（PFS）和总生存期（OS），并进行单因素和多因素分析。结果：中位随访68个月期间，观察到17例局部复发、27例区域复发和35例远处转移。5年LRFS、PFS和OS分别为82%、41%和76%。多因素分析显示分期是唯一与LRFS（p=0.040）、PFS（p<0.0001）和OS（p=0.048）相关的因素，而治疗方式仅与LRFS相关（p=0.015）。IGRT和ENI也与LRFS相关（分别为p=0.002和0.013）。Ⅳ期患者中，手术联合放疗组与根治性放疗组的PFS和OS无显著差异（分别为p=0.99和0.98）。结论：我们的结果表明针对分期的治疗策略比可切除性更重要，尤其对Ⅳ期患者。这些结果需在前瞻性研究中验证。研究还提示放疗方法影响复发。 | 40805209 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Focused Data Augmentation Methods in Rib Fracture Detection in CT Images. | CT图像中肋骨骨折检测的传统与聚焦数据增强方法对比分析。 | Göktekin Mehmet Çağrı, Gül Evrim, Aksu Feyza, Gül Yeliz, Özen Metehan et al. | Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland) (2025) | Background/Objectives: Rib fracture detection holds critical importance in the field of medical image processing. Methods: In this study, two different data augmentation methods, traditional data augmentation (Albumentations) and focused data augmentation (focused augmentation), were compared using computed tomography (CT) images for the detection of rib fractures on YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv8m models. While the traditional data augmentation method applies general transformations to the entire image, the focused data augmentation method performs specific transformations by targeting only the fracture regions. Results: The model performance was evaluated using the Precision, Recall, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 metrics. The findings revealed that the focused data augmentation method achieved superior performance in certain metrics. Specifically, analysis on the YOLOv8s model showed that the focused data augmentation method increased the mAP@50 value by 2.18%, reaching 0.9412, and improved the recall value for fracture detection by 5.70%, reaching 0.8766. On the other hand, the traditional data augmentation method achieved better results in overall precision metrics with the YOLOv8m model and provided a slight advantage in the mAP@50 value. Conclusions: The study indicates that focused data augmentation can contribute to achieving more reliable and accurate results in medical imaging applications. | 背景/目的：肋骨骨折检测在医学图像处理领域具有重要意义。方法：本研究使用计算机断层扫描（CT）图像，在YOLOv8n、YOLOv8s和YOLOv8m模型上比较了传统数据增强（Albumentations）与聚焦数据增强（focused augmentation）两种方法的效果。传统数据增强方法对整个图像进行通用变换，而聚焦数据增强方法仅针对骨折区域实施特定变换。结果：通过精确率（Precision）、召回率（Recall）、mAP@50和mAP@50-95指标评估模型性能。研究发现聚焦数据增强方法在部分指标上表现更优：YOLOv8s模型分析显示，该方法使mAP@50值提升2.18%至0.9412，骨折检测召回率提高5.70%至0.8766。而传统数据增强方法在YOLOv8m模型的整体精确率指标更佳，且在mAP@50值上略有优势。结论：研究表明，在医学影像应用中，聚焦数据增强有助于获得更可靠、更准确的结果。 | 40804902 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Orthognathic Surgery Need in Skeletal Class II Patients Using Facial Profile Images: An Artificial Intelligence Study. | 基于深度学习的面部侧貌图像预测骨骼II类患者正颌手术需求：一项人工智能研究 | Tahmasbi Soodeh, Shokoofi Hadi, Dalaie Kazem, Behnaz Mohammad, Aghdashi Farzad et al. | Journal of imaging informatics in medicine (2025) | Orthognathic surgery is often required to address moderate to severe skeletal class II malocclusion, a condition that affects both facial aesthetics and function. Traditional diagnosis relies on cephalometric radiographs and expert evaluation, which can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. The need for AI-assisted initial screening based exclusively on lateral soft tissue profiles is increasingly recognized, particularly for identifying mandibular retrusion relative to the maxilla. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based model for classifying lateral facial profile photographs into surgical (S) and non-surgical (NS) categories. A dataset of 524 standardized profile images from skeletal class II patients was collected from three dental centers. Each image was independently reviewed by a panel of five experts (three orthodontists and two maxillofacial surgeons), with labels assigned based on majority consensus. To minimize visual bias and enhance model performance, images underwent preprocessing involving facial cropping, background removal via U2-Net segmentation, silhouette contour extraction, and resizing to 128 × 128 pixels. A custom convolutional neural network (ContourNet) was developed and optimized using fivefold cross-validation. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 90%, with a precision of 92% for NS and 88% for S, and a recall of 88% for NS and 92% for S. Saliency maps revealed that the model focused on clinically relevant regions, particularly the lower jaw and chin in surgical cases. This deep learning framework demonstrates strong potential as a non-invasive, efficient tool for preliminary screening in orthognathic surgery decision-making. Further external validation on larger and more diverse populations is recommended prior to clinical implementation. | 正颌手术通常用于治疗中重度骨性II类错颌畸形，这种疾病同时影响面部美观和功能。传统诊断依赖头影测量X光片和专家评估，耗时且存在观察者间差异。基于侧面软组织轮廓进行AI辅助初筛的需求日益受到重视，尤其是针对下颌相对于上颌后缩的识别。本研究旨在开发并评估一种基于深度学习的模型，用于将侧面面部轮廓照片分类为手术（S）和非手术（NS）两类。研究收集了来自三个牙科中心的524张骨性II类患者的标准化侧面图像，每张图像由五位专家（三位正畸医生和两位颌面外科医生）独立评审，根据多数共识确定标签。为减少视觉偏差并提升模型性能，图像预处理包括面部裁剪、通过U2-Net分割去除背景、提取轮廓剪影并调整为128×128像素。研究开发了定制卷积神经网络（ContourNet）并通过五折交叉验证进行优化。模型总体准确率达90%，NS和S的精确率分别为92%和88%，召回率分别为88%和92%。显著性图显示模型聚焦于临床相关区域，手术案例中尤其关注下颌和颏部。该深度学习框架展现出作为无创高效工具的潜力，可用于正颌手术决策的初步筛查。建议临床实施前在更大规模多样化人群中进行外部验证。 | 40804594 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Comparative analysis of AI support levels in clinical interpretation of traumatic pelvic radiographs. | 创伤性骨盆X光片临床解读中AI支持水平的比较分析。 | Tee Yu-San, Huang Jen-Fu, Huang Yu-Ting, Hsu Chi-Po, Chen Huan-Wu et al. | NPJ digital medicine (2025) | Plain pelvic radiographs (PXR) remain crucial for initial trauma assessment, yet interpretation challenges persist. While artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise, its practical impact across specialties remains unexplored. We conducted a retrospective image-based, multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study using a standardized, prospectively planned evaluation protocol. A total of 26 physicians (8 radiologists, 10 emergency physicians, 8 trauma surgeons) interpreted 150 PXRs in three sequential sessions: without AI, with AI-alert, and with AI-visual guidance. AI assistance improved overall diagnostic accuracy from 0.870 to 0.940 (p < 0.001) and reduced interpretation time from 22.70 to 9.58 s (p < 0.001). Non-radiologists showed substantial improvements, with emergency physicians demonstrating increases in specificity (26.2%, p = 0.006) and positive predictive value (41.5%, p = 0.006). Trauma surgeons with AI-visual guidance achieved comparable accuracy to unaided radiologists (0.940 vs. 0.920, p = 0.556). Tailored AI assistance effectively bridges the performance gap between radiologists and non-radiologists while reducing reading time. These findings suggest AI integration could enhance clinical workflow efficiency across specialties in trauma care settings. | 普通骨盆X光片（PXR）在创伤初步评估中仍至关重要，但其解读挑战持续存在。尽管人工智能（AI）展现出潜力，但其跨专科的实际影响尚未明确。我们采用标准化前瞻性评估方案，开展了一项基于影像的回顾性多阅片者多病例（MRMC）研究。26名医师（8名放射科医师、10名急诊医师、8名创伤外科医师）分三个阶段解读150份PXR：无AI辅助、AI警报辅助及AI视觉引导辅助。AI辅助将总体诊断准确率从0.870提升至0.940（p < 0.001），解读时间从22.70秒缩短至9.58秒（p < 0.001）。非放射科医师改善显著，其中急诊医师的特异性（26.2%，p = 0.006）和阳性预测值（41.5%，p = 0.006）显著提高。创伤外科医师在AI视觉引导下达到与无辅助放射科医师相当的准确率（0.940 vs. 0.920，p = 0.556）。定制化AI辅助有效弥合了放射科与非放射科医师间的表现差距，同时缩短读片时间。这些发现表明，AI整合可提升创伤护理场景中各专科的临床工作效率。 | 40804461 | Medical Image Analysis |

Despite the growing popularity of CMR-based myocardial strain calculations, measures of complete spatiotemporal strains (i.e., three-dimensional strains over the cardiac cycle) remain elusive, especially in mice. The high metabolic rates and rapid cardiac motion affect high-resolution imaging, thus compromising strain accuracy. We hypothesize that a super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) framework that combines low-resolution scans at multiple orientations will enhance the reliability of complete spatiotemporal strains in mice. | 通过心脏磁共振成像（CMR）评估的心脏病结构指标已显示出作为早期标志物的潜力。尽管基于CMR的心肌应变计算日益普及，但完整时空应变（即整个心动周期的三维应变）的测量仍难以实现，尤其是在小鼠中。高代谢率和快速心脏运动影响了高分辨率成像，从而降低了应变的准确性。我们假设，结合多方位低分辨率扫描的超分辨率重建（SRR）框架将提高小鼠完整时空应变的可靠性。 | 40804353 | Medical Image Analysis |
| A novel brain MRI classification framework integrating tuned single scale retinex and empirical wavelet entropy features. | 一种集成调谐单尺度视网膜和经验小波熵特征的新型脑MRI分类框架。 | Kumar Paravathanani Rajendra, Prakash Krishna, Teja Buraga Ram Sai, Manoj Kota Akhil, Bhuvaneswar Adi et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | Brain tumors are caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which are often irregular in shape. Growing at such a rate of about 1.4% per day, the abnormal rate of growth accounts for an invisible illness and depressive behavioral changes; hence, brain tumors have become a major cause of increased death rates among adults worldwide. The prognosis of a brain tumor can be improved significantly if the tumor is diagnosed early using different imaging modalities. Out of these various imaging systems, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most commonly used diagnostic modality because it is non-invasive and provides clear visualization of brain tissues. This study proposes a novel brain MRI image classification framework involving image enhancement, adaptive decomposition, statistical feature extraction, and a supervised classification method. First, the contrast of magnetic resonance is improved through the Tuned Single-Scale Retinex (TSSR) technique. Afterward, these enhanced images are decomposed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) so that informative subbands can be extracted. From each subband, energy and entropy features (Shannon and Tsallis) are computed and concatenated into a feature vector. This feature set is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) and LPBoost classifiers. The model was evaluated on a binary-class brain MRI dataset comprising 280 images sourced from the Harvard Medical School and Kaggle repositories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.43%, with a true positive rate (TPR) of 100% and a true negative rate (TNR) of 77.78%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The primary contributions include the introduction of EWT-based statistical features for brain MRI classification and the use of TSSR for enhanced image quality, offering a robust and generalizable solution for medical image analysis. | 脑肿瘤由脑内细胞异常增生引发，这些细胞通常形状不规则。以每日约1.4%的速度增长，这种异常增殖导致隐匿性病症和抑郁行为改变，因此脑肿瘤已成为全球成人死亡率上升的主要原因。若通过不同影像学手段早期诊断，脑肿瘤预后可显著改善。在多种成像系统中，磁共振成像（MRI）因其无创性和清晰的脑组织显影成为最常用的诊断方式。本研究提出一种新型脑MRI图像分类框架，包含图像增强、自适应分解、统计特征提取和监督分类方法。首先通过调谐单尺度视网膜技术（TSSR）提升磁共振对比度，随后利用经验小波变换（EWT）分解增强后的图像以提取信息丰富的子带。从每个子带计算能量及熵特征（香农熵与Tsallis熵），并拼接成特征向量。该特征集用于训练支持向量机（SVM）和LPBoost分类器。模型在包含280张图像的二元分类脑MRI数据集（源自哈佛医学院和Kaggle数据库）上评估，实验结果显示所提框架分类准确率达96.43%，真阳性率（TPR）100%，真阴性率（TNR）77.78%，性能优于多种先进方法。主要创新点包括引入基于EWT的统计特征进行脑MRI分类，以及采用TSSR提升图像质量，为医学影像分析提供了鲁棒且可推广的解决方案。 | 40804243 | Medical Image Analysis |

The similar clinical presentation of sore throat in bacterial and nonbacterial infections poses significant diagnostic challenges, even for experienced clinicians. To address this, we developed a publicly available dataset consisting of high-resolution throat images captured using smartphone cameras. These images were analyzed through deep neural networks to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial infections based on visual features and symptoms. The dataset is the largest publicly available dataset in this field, which includes images from 742 patients experiencing common cold symptoms. For each patient, it also records the presence or absence of 20 symptoms, age, gender, and between 4 to 9 diagnoses by different physicians. Furthermore, three baseline models were established to differentiate bacterial from nonbacterial infections. Our goal is to enhance the field of non-invasive and accurate pharyngitis diagnosis, drive the development of AI-driven diagnostic tools, promote remote healthcare solutions, and inspire future innovations in medical image analysis. | 准确且早期区分细菌性与非细菌性咽炎对于优化治疗和减少不必要的抗生素使用至关重要。细菌性和非细菌性感染引起的喉咙痛临床表现相似，这给诊断带来了重大挑战，即使对经验丰富的临床医生也是如此。为解决这一问题，我们开发了一个公开可用的数据集，包含通过智能手机摄像头拍摄的高分辨率咽喉图像。这些图像通过深度神经网络进行分析，以基于视觉特征和症状区分细菌性和非细菌性感染。该数据集是该领域最大的公开可用数据集，包含742名出现感冒症状患者的图像。每位患者的数据还记录了20种症状的有无、年龄、性别以及4至9位不同医生的诊断结果。此外，我们还建立了三个基线模型来区分细菌性和非细菌性感染。我们的目标是推动无创且准确的咽炎诊断领域的发展，促进人工智能驱动的诊断工具的开发，推动远程医疗解决方案的进步，并激发未来在医学图像分析方面的创新。 | 40804134 | Medical Image Analysis |
| In vivo variability of MRI radiomics features in prostate lesions assessed by a test-retest study with repositioning. | 通过重定位测试-再测试研究评估前列腺病变中MRI影像组学特征的体内变异性。 | Zhang Kevin Sun, Neelsen Christian Jan Oliver, Wennmann Markus, Hielscher Thomas, Kovacs Balint et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | Despite academic success, radiomics-based machine learning algorithms have not reached clinical practice, partially due to limited repeatability/reproducibility. To address this issue, this work aims to identify a stable subset of radiomics features in prostate MRI for radiomics modelling. A prospective study was conducted in 43 patients who received a clinical MRI examination and a research exam with repetition of T2-weighted and two different diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with repositioning in between. Radiomics feature (RF) extraction was performed from MRI segmentations accounting for intra-rater and inter-rater effects, and three different image normalization methods were compared. Stability of RFs was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for different comparisons: rater effects, inter-scan (before and after repositioning) and inter-sequence (between the two diffusion-weighted sequences) variability. In total, only 64 out of 321 (~ 20%) extracted features demonstrated stability, defined as CCC ≥ 0.75 in all settings (5 high-b value, 7 ADC- and 52 T2-derived features). For DWI, primarily intensity-based features proved stable with no shape feature passing the CCC threshold. T2-weighted images possessed the largest number of stable features with multiple shape (7), intensity-based (7) and texture features (28). Z-score normalization for high-b value images and muscle-normalization for T2-weighted images were identified as suitable. | 尽管在学术上取得了成功，基于放射组学的机器学习算法尚未进入临床实践，部分原因在于其可重复性/再现性有限。为解决这一问题，本研究旨在识别前列腺MRI中一组稳定的放射组学特征用于建模。研究对43名患者进行了前瞻性分析，这些患者接受了临床MRI检查及重复的科研扫描，包括T2加权和两种不同扩散加权成像（DWI）序列的重复采集，期间进行了体位重置。通过考虑评分者内和评分者间差异的MRI分割进行放射组学特征（RF）提取，并比较了三种图像标准化方法。采用一致性相关系数（CCC）评估特征在不同场景下的稳定性：评分者效应、扫描间（体位重置前后）及序列间（两种DWI序列间）变异。结果显示，在提取的321个特征中，仅64个（约20%）在所有设定下均达到CCC≥0.75的稳定性标准（5个高b值特征、7个ADC特征及52个T2衍生特征）。DWI序列中主要为稳定的强度特征，无形状特征通过CCC阈值；T2加权图像则拥有最多稳定特征，包括7个形状特征、7个强度特征和28个纹理特征。研究确定高b值图像适合Z-score标准化，而T2加权图像适合肌肉标准化。 | 40804076 | Medical Image Analysis |

| DMP-Net: Deep semantic prior compressed spectral reconstruction method towards intraoperative imaging of brain tissue. | DMP-Net：面向脑组织术中成像的深度语义先验压缩光谱重建方法 | Cao Chipeng, Li Jie, Wang Pan, Qi Chun | Medical image analysis (2025) | In the diagnosis and surgical resection of brain tumors, hyperspectral imaging, as a non-invasive detection technology, can effectively characterize the morphological structure and the physicochemical differences in cellular metabolism of different tissues. However, live tissues typically exhibit certain motion characteristics, and traditional hyperspectral imaging systems struggle to meet the demands for real-time and rapid imaging. The snapshot compressive spectral imaging (CSI) system can quickly acquire spatial spectral information of the lesion area in a single exposure and, combined with reconstruction algorithms, effectively restore the high-dimensional spectral information of brain tissue. High-quality reconstruction results are crucial for ensuring the reliability of spectral analysis of brain tissue. To improve the reconstruction performance of the CSI system, this paper proposes a compressive spectral reconstruction method based on deep semantic prior regularization. The predicted results of the deep convolutional prior model are used as the initial spectral estimate to establish a regularization term for the reconstruction process. This is combined with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize the solution for high-dimensional spectral images of brain tissue. The results show that using the CSI system for intraoperative brain tissue imaging can rapidly acquire spatial spectral information of the lesion area. By optimizing the reconstruction process with the deep convolutional prior model, this method not only better preserves the structural consistency of spectral images from different patients but also fully considers the spectral differences of different types of brain tumors, achieving higher reconstruction quality. This provides strong support for the precise localization and resection of brain tumors.

| MoACNN-XGNet: Interpretable Multi-Omics Convolutional Network for Breast Cancer Subtyping and Prognostic Genes Identification. | MoACNN-XGNet：用于乳腺癌分型和预后基因识别的可解释多组学卷积网络。 | Li Qian, Liu Lei, Zhang Qing, Zhang Xiaobin, Li Na et al. | IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics (2025) | Breast cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease at both the phenotypic and molecular levels, presents significant challenges for prognosis and treatment. Accurate subtyping of breast cancer is critical due to its complex biological characteristics, which directly influence disease progression and therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we integrate multi-omics data, including copy number variation, RNA sequencing and DNA methylation, to generate two-dimensional representations of each sample using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. This transformation enhances data interpretability and supports subsequent learning tasks. Traditional convolutional neural networks have demonstrated potential in medical image analysis but often struggle with high-dimensional omics data. To address this limitation, we propose MoACNN-XGNet, an attention-based convolutional neural network framework that prioritizes key features within image-transformed multi-omics data. Our method significantly improves the precision of subtype classification and effectively overcomes the challenges posed by the high dimensionality and structural complexity of multi-omics data. Furthermore, we employ the Guided Grad-CAM method to enhance model interpretability, enabling the identification of subtype-specific explainable genes. Subsequent enrichment and survival analyses of these genes reveal critical biological pathways and potential therapeutic targets. This study offers a novel approach to refining breast cancer subtyping and highlights the potential for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately aiming to improve patient survival outcomes. | 乳腺癌在表型和分子水平上均表现出高度异质性，这为预后和治疗带来了重大挑战。由于其复杂的生物学特性直接影响疾病进展和治疗效果，乳腺癌的精准分型至关重要。本研究整合了拷贝数变异、RNA测序和DNA甲基化等多组学数据，利用均匀流形逼近与投影技术生成每个样本的二维表征。这种转换增强了数据的可解释性，并为后续学习任务提供了支持。传统卷积神经网络在医学图像分析中展现出潜力，但面对高维多组学数据时往往表现不佳。为此，我们提出MoACNN-XGNet框架——一种基于注意力机制的卷积神经网络，能够优先处理图像化多组学数据中的关键特征。该方法显著提升了亚型分类的精确度，有效克服了多组学数据高维性和结构复杂性带来的挑战。此外，我们采用导向梯度加权类激活映射方法增强模型可解释性，从而识别出亚型特异性可解释基因。对这些基因进行的富集分析和生存分析揭示了关键生物学通路和潜在治疗靶点。本研究为完善乳腺癌分型提供了新思路，并凸显了个性化治疗策略的潜力，最终有望改善患者生存预后。 | 40802631 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Brain compensation and volume alterations in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis: a cross-sectional neuroimaging study. | 严重膝骨关节炎患者的脑补偿与体积变化：一项横断面神经影像学研究。 | Chaim Fuad F, Imamura Marta, Chaim-Avancini Tiffany M, Leite Claudia C, Squarzoni Paula et al. | Rheumatology international (2025) | Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease worldwide and the leading cause of functional disability. Recent studies have shown alterations in gray matter (GM) volume in areas related to pain sensitivity and perception in patients experiencing chronic pain. These brain changes may be reversible once pain relief is obtained. This study aimed to compare brain volume measurements in patients with chronic pain due to knee OA with healthy controls using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. Additionally, we aimed to correlate these findings with motor functional capacity and stiffness data. We selected 29 adults with severe knee OA and 28 healthy controls, matched for age and gender. All participants underwent MRI, and the images were processed and analyzed using the VBM method with the SPM 8 program. Predefined brain areas, including the insula, prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral cortex, ventrolateral cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus, were selected for comparative analysis. We observed a reduction in GM volume in patients with knee OA pain compared to healthy controls in several regions, including the right and left anterior cingulate gyrus, right amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, left amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, right precuneus, and right insula. Additionally, we observed an increase in GM volume in the right and left orbitofrontal cortex and right superior temporal cortex. Our results support the hypothesis that knee OA-related pain is associated with region-specific volumetric brain alterations. Importantly, the observed increases in orbitofrontal and temporal GM volume may reflect compensatory neuroplasticity in response to chronic pain burden. These findings align with emerging models of brain compensation. Understanding these patterns may facilitate the development of prognostic and surrogate biomarkers for chronic pain and inform brain-targeted rehabilitation strategies. | 骨关节炎（OA）是全球最常见的关节疾病，也是导致功能障碍的主要原因。近期研究表明，慢性疼痛患者在与疼痛敏感性和感知相关的脑区会出现灰质（GM）体积的改变。这些大脑变化可能在疼痛缓解后得到逆转。本研究旨在通过脑磁共振成像（MRI）和基于体素的形态测量（VBM）分析，比较膝OA慢性疼痛患者与健康对照者的大脑体积差异，并将这些发现与运动功能能力和僵硬数据相关联。我们选取了29名重度膝OA成年患者和28名年龄性别匹配的健康对照者。所有参与者均接受MRI检查，图像使用SPM 8程序进行VBM方法处理和分析。预定义的脑区包括岛叶、前额叶皮质、背外侧皮质、腹外侧皮质、颞叶皮质、顶叶皮质、扣带回和丘脑，用于比较分析。结果显示，与健康对照组相比，膝OA疼痛患者的多个脑区GM体积减少，包括左右前扣带回、右侧杏仁核、海马、海马旁回、左侧杏仁核、海马、海马旁回、右侧楔前叶和右侧岛叶。此外，在左右眶额皮质和右侧颞上皮质观察到GM体积增加。这些结果支持膝OA相关疼痛与特定脑区体积改变相关的假说。值得注意的是，眶额叶和颞叶灰质体积的增加可能反映了慢性疼痛负荷引发的代偿性神经可塑性。这些发现与新兴的脑代偿模型一致。理解这些模式有助于开发慢性疼痛的预后和替代生物标志物，并为针对大脑的康复策略提供依据。 | 40802103 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Smartphone-Powered Pdot Biosensors for Quantitative Phenylketonuria Screening at the Point of Care. | 智能手机驱动的Pdot生物传感器用于苯丙酮尿症即时定量筛查。 | Zeng Zirui, Dai Yanchun, Deng Sile, Liu Zihao, Feng Ruixin et al. | Advanced healthcare materials (2025) | Current clinical management of hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria (PKU) lacks accessible, real-time diagnostic tools. To address this gap, a portable biosensing system integrating semiconducting polymer dot (Pdot) technology with miniaturized optics for rapid phenylalanine quantification is developed. The biosensor leverages phenylalanine dehydrogenase to enzymatically convert phenylalanine into NADH, enabling ratiometric fluorescence detection through electron transfer-mediated quenching of Pdots by NADH. This mechanism achieves exceptional sensitivity in human plasma, with a limit of detection (0.29 µm) surpassing conventional methods, alongside robust photostability. To ensure clinical practicality, the platform incorporates a 3D-printed, light-isolated housing and a compact optical module, enhancing field-deployable durability. A dedicated smartphone application facilitates real-time image capture and chromatic analysis, translating fluorescence signals into quantitative phenylalanine levels via a calibrated B/R ratio algorithm. Validation studies demonstrated linear correlation across the pathophysiological range (0-2400 µm), outperforming existing assays in accuracy and inter-device consistency. By merging biochemical specificity with engineered hardware, this innovation bridges laboratory-grade precision with point-of-care usability, providing a scalable solution for early diagnosis and personalized management of PKU and related metabolic disorders. | 目前对高苯丙氨酸血症和苯丙酮尿症（PKU）的临床管理缺乏便捷、实时的诊断工具。为填补这一空白，本研究开发了一种便携式生物传感系统，该系统将半导体聚合物点（Pdot）技术与微型光学元件相结合，用于快速定量苯丙氨酸。该生物传感器利用苯丙氨酸脱氢酶将苯丙氨酸酶促转化为NADH，通过NADH介导的电子转移淬灭Pdots，实现比率荧光检测。该机制在人血浆中展现出卓越的灵敏度（检测限0.29µm），超越传统方法，并具有优异的光稳定性。为确保临床实用性，平台采用3D打印避光外壳和紧凑光学模块，增强了现场应用的耐用性。专用智能手机应用程序支持实时图像采集与色度分析，通过校准的B/R比值算法将荧光信号转化为定量苯丙氨酸浓度。验证研究表明，该系统在病理生理范围（0-2400µm）内呈线性相关，在准确性和设备间一致性上优于现有检测方法。这项创新将生化特异性与工程化硬件相结合，实现了实验室级精度与床旁可用性的统一，为PKU及相关代谢疾病的早期诊断和个性化管理提供了可扩展的解决方案。 | 40801112 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Functional brain mapping using whole-head very high-density diffuse optical tomography. | 使用全头超高密度漫射光学断层扫描进行功能性脑图谱绘制。 | Fogarty Morgan, Rafferty Sean M, Markow Zachary E, O'Sullivan Anthony C, Svoboda Calamity F et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2025) | Naturalistic neuroimaging tasks, such as watching movies, are becoming increasingly popular due to being more engaging than resting-state paradigms and more ecologically valid than isolated block-design tasks. As these tasks push the boundaries of naturalistic paradigms, the need for an equally naturalistic imaging device increases. Optical imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a wearable, non-invasive neuroimaging approach. Advancements in high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) use a dense array of optical elements to provide overlapping multi-distance fNIRS light measurements for fidelity comparable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, to further improve image quality, we increased the density of the imaging grid to 9.75 mm, first nearest neighbor spacing between sources and detectors, leading to a 4-fold increase in measurement density. This very high-density DOT (VHD-DOT) system uses 255 sources and 252 detectors to improve image quality while expanding the field of view. From simulations, the increased density led to improved image resolution across multiple metrics compared with HD-DOT. In vivo group-averaged functional localizer maps are in strong agreement with those collected in MRI on the same cohort of adult participants, indicating that VHD-DOT can be used as a surrogate for fMRI in task-based studies. For a naturalistic movie-viewing task, feature regressor analysis was employed to map audiovisual features from the clip, which also revealed excellent agreement between VHD-DOT and fMRI. Template-based decoding of task and movie-viewing data demonstrates that VHD-DOT signals are repeatable and discriminable, which is necessary for more advanced naturalistic task analyses. This work builds upon previously reported HD-DOT designs to improve the image quality and resolution for whole-head optical imaging. This system is promising for future studies using complex stimuli and analysis protocols, such as decoding, and future work developing wireless VHD-DOT systems. | 自然主义神经影像任务，如观看电影，正变得越来越受欢迎，因为它们比静息态范式更具吸引力，比孤立的区块设计任务更具生态效度。随着这些任务不断拓展自然主义范式的边界，对同样自然主义的成像设备的需求也在增加。功能性近红外光谱（fNIRS）光学成像提供了一种可穿戴、非侵入性的神经影像方法。高密度漫射光学断层扫描（HD-DOT）技术的进步利用密集排列的光学元件，提供重叠的多距离fNIRS光测量，其保真度可与功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）相媲美。为了进一步提高图像质量，我们将成像网格的密度提高到9.75毫米，即光源与探测器之间的第一最近邻间距，从而使测量密度提高了4倍。这种超高密度DOT（VHD-DOT）系统使用255个光源和252个探测器，在扩大视野的同时提升了图像质量。模拟结果显示，与HD-DOT相比，密度的增加在多项指标上均改善了图像分辨率。活体组平均功能定位图与同一组成年参与者在MRI中采集的结果高度一致，表明VHD-DOT可作为基于任务研究中fMRI的替代方案。在自然主义观影任务中，采用特征回归分析对片段中的视听特征进行映射，结果也显示VHD-DOT与fMRI之间具有极好的一致性。基于模板的任务和观影数据解码表明，VHD-DOT信号具有可重复性和可区分性，这是进行更高级自然主义任务分析的必要条件。本研究在先前报道的HD-DOT设计基础上，提升了全头光学成像的图像质量和分辨率。该系统有望用于未来使用复杂刺激和分析协议（如解码）的研究，并为开发无线VHD-DOT系统的后续工作奠定基础。 | 40800993 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Localizing hierarchical prediction errors and precisions during an oddball task with volatility: Computational insights and relationship with psychosocial functioning in healthy individuals. | 在具有波动性的奇异任务中定位层次预测误差与精度：健康个体的计算洞察及其与心理社会功能的关系。 | Charlton Colleen E, Hauke Daniel J, Wobmann Michelle, de Bock Renate, Andreou Christina et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2025) | The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been widely used to investigate deficits in early auditory information processing, particularly in psychosis. Predictive coding theories suggest that impairments in sensory learning may arise from disturbances in hierarchical message passing, likely due to aberrant precision-weighting of prediction errors (PEs). This study employed a modified auditory oddball paradigm with varying phases of stability and volatility to disentangle the impact of hierarchical PEs on auditory MMN generation in 43 healthy controls (HCs). Single-trial EEG data were modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian model of learning to identify neural correlates of low-level PEs about tones and high-level PEs about environmental volatility. Our analysis revealed a reduced expression of the auditory MMN in volatile compared to stable phases of the paradigm. Additionally, lower Global Functioning (GF): Social scores were associated with a reduced difference waveform at 332 ms after stimulus presentation across the entire MMN paradigm. Further analysis revealed that this association was present during the volatile phase but not the stable phase of the paradigm. Source reconstruction suggested that the association between the stable difference waveform and psychosocial functioning originated in the left superior temporal gyrus. Finally, we found significant EEG signatures of both low- and high-level PEs and precision ratios. Our findings highlight the value of computational models in understanding the neural mechanisms involved in early auditory information processing and their connection to psychosocial functioning. | 听觉失匹配负波（MMN）被广泛用于研究早期听觉信息处理的缺陷，特别是在精神病患者中。预测编码理论认为，感觉学习障碍可能源于层级信息传递的紊乱，这很可能是由于预测错误（PEs）的精度加权异常所致。本研究采用了一种改进的听觉oddball范式，通过稳定和波动阶段的变化，来探究层级PEs对43名健康对照组（HCs）听觉MMN生成的影响。通过单试次脑电图数据与层级贝叶斯学习模型的结合，我们识别了与低层级（音调相关）PEs和高层级（环境波动相关）PEs相关的神经活动。分析显示，在范式波动阶段，听觉MMN的表达较稳定阶段有所减弱。此外，在整个MMN范式中，较低的全球功能（GF）：社交评分与刺激呈现后332毫秒处的差异波形减弱相关。进一步分析表明，这种关联仅存在于范式的波动阶段，而非稳定阶段。源定位分析提示，稳定差异波形与心理社会功能之间的关联源于左侧颞上回。最后，我们发现了低层级和高层级PEs及其精度比值的显著脑电图特征。这些发现凸显了计算模型在理解早期听觉信息处理的神经机制及其与心理社会功能联系中的价值。 | 40800881 | Medical Image Analysis |
| The effects of musicality on brain network topology in the context of Alzheimer's disease and memory decline. | 音乐性对阿尔茨海默病和记忆衰退背景下大脑网络拓扑结构的影响。 | Matziorinis Anna Maria, Leemans Alexander, Skouras Stavros, Flo Birthe Kristin, Bashevkin Tobias et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024) | Music's role in modulating brain structure, particularly in neurodegenerative contexts such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), has been increasingly recognized. While previous studies have hinted at the potential neuroplastic benefits of musical engagement and training, the mechanisms through which music impacts structural connectivity in neurodegenerative pathways remain underexplored. We aimed to examine the impact of music perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity in areas relating to memory, emotion, and learning in individuals with worsening memory impairment, investigating the potential neuroplastic effects of music. Employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based structural connectivity and graph theoretical analysis, we investigated brain topological features in 78 participants aged 42 to 85 with a range of memory impairments. Participants were assessed for musical training, engagement, and perception skills. The study analyzed regional and local network topological metrics to examine the influence of musical activities on graph metrics, while controlling for stages of objective memory impairment (SOMI) and diagnosis, separately. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of musical perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity within memory, emotion, and learning-related brain areas in individuals with varying degrees of memory impairment. We found enhanced structural connectivity of the right hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate cortex was associated with stronger local network metrics, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, with increased music perception skills like melody and beat perception. Musical training specifically impacted the clustering coefficient of the right hippocampus and the node degree of the right mid cingulate gyrus. Active musical engagement influenced the eigenvector centrality of the right hippocampus. Furthermore, musical training was associated with enhanced global metrics, such as global efficiency and characteristic path length. Our study integrates diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and graph theoretical analysis to reveal significant effects of musical activities on structural connectivity in key brain regions. The results highlight the potential of musical activities to serve as a non-invasive modulatory tool for cognitive resilience, especially in memory impairment and neurodegeneration contexts. These insights contribute to the understanding of delaying AD onset and aiding early-stage patients through music-based interventions, emphasizing the importance of musical engagement in maintaining cognitive and brain health. | 音乐在调节大脑结构中的作用，尤其在阿尔茨海默病（AD）等神经退行性疾病中日益受到关注。尽管先前研究暗示音乐参与和训练可能带来神经可塑性益处，但音乐如何影响神经退行性通路中结构连接的机制仍待深入探索。本研究旨在探究音乐感知能力、主动音乐参与和音乐训练对记忆衰退患者记忆、情绪及学习相关脑区结构连接的影响，以揭示音乐的潜在神经可塑性效应。<br><br>我们采用基于弥散张量成像（DTI）的结构连接与图论分析方法，对42至85岁共78名存在不同程度记忆障碍的参与者进行脑拓扑特征研究。通过评估参与者的音乐训练经历、参与程度及感知技能，在分别控制客观记忆损伤阶段（SOMI）和诊断结果后，分析区域性与局部网络拓扑指标，以考察音乐活动对图指标的影响。<br><br>研究发现：随着旋律和节拍感知等音乐感知能力的提升，右侧海马与右侧后扣带回的结构连接增强，表现为聚类系数和介数中心性等局部网络指标优化；音乐训练特异性影响右侧海马的聚类系数和右侧中扣带回的节点度；主动音乐参与则改变右侧海马的特征向量中心性。此外，音乐训练与全局效率及特征路径长度等整体指标提升相关。<br><br>本研究融合弥散磁共振成像（MRI）与图论分析，首次系统揭示音乐活动对关键脑区结构连接的显著影响。结果凸显音乐活动作为非侵入性调节工具的潜力，可增强认知韧性，尤其对记忆障碍和神经退行性病变群体具有特殊价值。这些发现为理解音乐干预延缓AD发病、辅助早期患者提供了新依据，强调了音乐参与对维持认知与脑健康的重要性。 | 40800535 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Self-supervised representation learning for nerve fiber distribution patterns in 3D-PLI. | 3D-PLI中神经纤维分布模式的自监督表征学习。 | Oberstrass Alexander, Muenzing Sascha E A, Niu Meiqi, Palomero-Gallagher Nicola, Schiffer Christian et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024) | A comprehensive understanding of the organizational principles in the human brain requires, among other factors, well-quantifiable descriptors of nerve fiber architecture. Three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) is a microscopic imaging technique that enables insights into the fine-grained organization of myelinated nerve fibers with high resolution. Descriptors characterizing the fiber architecture observed in 3D-PLI would enable downstream analysis tasks such as multimodal correlation studies, clustering, and mapping. However, best practices for observer-independent characterization of fiber architecture in 3D-PLI are not yet available. To this end, we propose the application of a fully data-driven approach to characterize nerve fiber architecture in 3D-PLI images using self-supervised representation learning. We introduce a3D-Context Contrastive Learning(CL-3D) objective that utilizes the spatial neighborhood of texture examples across histological brain sections of a 3D reconstructed volume to sample positive pairs for contrastive learning. We combine this sampling strategy with specifically designed image augmentations to gain robustness to typical variations in 3D-PLI parameter maps. The approach is demonstrated for the 3D reconstructed occipital lobe of a vervet monkey brain. We show that extracted features are highly sensitive to different configurations of nerve fibers, yet robust to variations between consecutive brain sections arising from histological processing. We demonstrate their practical applicability for retrieving clusters of homogeneous fiber architecture, performing classification with minimal annotations and query-based retrieval of characteristic components of fiber architecture such as U-fibers. | 全面理解人脑的组织原则需要多种因素，其中包括对神经纤维结构的可量化描述。三维偏振光成像（3D-PLI）是一种显微成像技术，能够以高分辨率揭示有髓神经纤维的精细组织结构。通过描述3D-PLI中观察到的纤维结构特征，可实现多模态关联研究、聚类和映射等下游分析任务。然而，目前尚缺乏对3D-PLI纤维结构进行客观表征的最佳实践。为此，我们提出应用一种完全数据驱动的方法，利用自监督表示学习来表征3D-PLI图像中的神经纤维结构。我们引入了**三维上下文对比学习（CL-3D）**目标，利用三维重建体积中连续脑组织切片的纹理样本空间邻域来采样对比学习的正样本对。结合专门设计的图像增强策略，该方法能有效应对3D-PLI参数图的典型变异。研究以绿猴大脑枕叶的三维重建为例，证明提取的特征对神经纤维的不同配置高度敏感，同时对组织处理导致的连续切片变异保持稳健。这些特征可实际应用于：检索同质纤维结构聚类、通过极少量标注进行分类，以及基于查询检索纤维结构的特征成分（如U型纤维）。 | 40800494 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Isoflurane titration improves detection of hippocampal lactate by 1 H-MRS. | 异氟醚滴定提高了1H-MRS对海马乳酸盐的检测能力。 | Frame Ariel K, Khazaee Reza, Courchesne Marc, Wilson Scott K, Bellyou Miranda et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024) | Lactate has increasingly been recognized as both an important fuel source and a signaling molecule within the brain. Alterations in brain lactate levels are associated with various neurological diseases. Thus, there is great interest in thein vivodetection and measurement of cerebral lactate levels in animals used for investigation of normal brain function and models of disease. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive technique used to measure lactate and other metabolites within the brain. However, lactate can be difficult to detect with conventional1H-MRS due to its low abundance and spectral overlap with lipids. In addition, volatile anesthetics used during image acquisition increase lactate production, potentially masking any subtle physiological changes in lactate levels. Here, we made use of a transgenic mouse model in which expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha), the rate-limiting enzyme of lactate production, was induced within cortical and hippocampal neurons. Unexpectedly,1H-MRS analysis, under typical isoflurane-induced anesthesia of 4% induction followed by 1.6-2% maintenance, revealed no significant elevation of hippocampal lactate levels in neuronalLdhainduction mice compared to control mice. In contrast,1H-MRS analysis, using an isoflurane titration protocol in which mice were sequentially exposed to 1.6%, 2%, and then finally 3% isoflurane, revealed significantly higher hippocampal lactate levels inLdhatransgenic mice compared to controls. In addition, significantly fewer mice were required to detect differences in lactate levels using the isoflurane titration protocol compared to conventional isoflurane-induced anesthesia. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling for the effects of anesthesia when detecting changes in hippocampal lactate levelsin vivoand offer a novel protocol for enhanced cerebral lactate detection. | 乳酸在大脑中被日益认为既是重要的能量来源，也是关键的信号分子。脑内乳酸水平的改变与多种神经系统疾病相关。因此，活体检测和测量用于研究正常脑功能及疾病模型动物的脑乳酸水平备受关注。质子磁共振波谱（1H-MRS）是一种用于测量脑内乳酸及其他代谢产物的非侵入性技术。然而，由于乳酸含量低且与脂质存在光谱重叠，传统1H-MRS难以检测乳酸。此外，图像采集过程中使用的挥发性麻醉剂会增加乳酸生成，可能掩盖乳酸水平的细微生理变化。本研究利用转基因小鼠模型，在皮质和海马神经元中诱导表达乳酸生成限速酶——乳酸脱氢酶A（Ldha）。出乎意料的是，在常规异氟烷麻醉（诱导浓度4%，维持浓度1.6-2%）下进行1H-MRS分析时，神经元Ldha诱导小鼠的海马乳酸水平与对照组相比未显著升高。而采用异氟烷梯度给药方案（依次暴露于1.6%、2%和最终3%异氟烷）进行1H-MRS分析时，Ldha转基因小鼠的海马乳酸水平显著高于对照组。此外，与传统异氟烷麻醉相比，梯度给药方案检测乳酸水平差异所需的小鼠数量显著减少。我们的研究结果强调了活体检测海马乳酸水平变化时控制麻醉效应的重要性，并提出了一种增强脑乳酸检测的新方案。 | 40800453 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Cortical alterations associated with executive function deficits in youth with a congenital heart defect. | 先天性心脏缺陷青少年执行功能缺陷相关的皮层改变。 | Abboud Fatme, Easson Kaitlyn, Ehrler Melanie, Ziolkowski Justine, Rohlicek Charles V et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024) | Adolescents and young adults born with a complex congenital heart defect (CHD) are at risk for executive function (ExF) impairments, which contribute to the psychological and everyday burden of CHD. Cortical dysmaturation has been well described in fetuses and neonates with CHD and early evidence suggests that cortical alterations in thickness, surface area, and gyrification index are non-transient and can be observed in adolescents with CHD. However, cortical alterations have yet to be correlated with ExF deficits in youth with CHD. This study aims to use a data-driven approach to identify the most important cortical features associated with ExF deficits in adolescents and young adults with CHD. To do so, we combined two comparable datasets acquired at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and the University Children's Hospital Zurich, each including both youth with CHD and healthy controls. For each participant, a high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance image, a self-reported ExF assessment (the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Scale), and their clinical and demographic characteristics were available. Corticometric Iterative Vertex-Based Estimation of Thickness (CIVET) was used to extract cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and local gyrification index measures. Using orthogonal projective non-negative matrix factorization (OPNMF), we identified non-overlapping spatial components that integrate cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and local gyrification index and capture structural covariance across these features. Behavioral partial least squares correlation (bPLS) analysis was then used to compute correlations between the individual variability in the OPNMF covariance patterns and ExF outcomes for each subject. A total of 56 youth with CHD who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery before 3 years of age and 56 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in our analyses. Cortical grey matter volume, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area were found to be significantly reduced in CHD patients compared to controls. OPNMF identified 12 stable cortex-wide components summarizing the inter-subject variability in cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and local gyrification index. bPLS revealed two significant latent variables (LV) accounting for a total of 82.8% of the variance in the sample, each describing distinct patterns between the brain and cognitive data. LV1 summarized a pattern of belonging to the CHD group, worse scores on most Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Scale (BRIEF-A) scales, younger age at MRI, and female sex. This pattern was associated with increased cortical thickness, local gyrification index, and decreased cortical surface area in several OPNMF components. Finally, we identified a positive relationship between the LV1 brain-behavior pattern and total aortic cross-clamp time in the CHD group, indicating that longer aortic cross-clamp time was associated with worse neuropsychological outcomes. In this study, we uncover novel multivariate relationships between ExF and alterations in cortical thickness, surface area, and local gyrification index in adolescents and young adults with CHD using a data-driven approach. Although our findings highlight the important role played by the cortex in higher-order cognitive processes, future studies are needed to elucidate the individual contribution of individual and clinical attributes into the deficits observed in this population. | 患有复杂先天性心脏病（CHD）的青少年和年轻成人存在执行功能（ExF）受损的风险，这会加重CHD的心理和日常生活负担。胎儿和新生儿CHD患者的皮质发育不良已被充分描述，早期证据表明，皮质厚度、表面积和脑回指数的改变并非暂时性，在CHD青少年中仍可观察到。然而，这些皮质改变尚未与CHD青年的ExF缺陷相关联。本研究旨在采用数据驱动方法，识别与CHD青少年和年轻成人ExF缺陷相关的最重要皮质特征。为此，我们整合了麦吉尔大学健康中心研究所和苏黎世大学儿童医院的两个可比数据集，每组均包含CHD青年和健康对照。每位参与者均提供高分辨率T1加权磁共振图像、自我报告的ExF评估（成人执行功能行为评定量表，BRIEF-A）及其临床和人口统计学特征。采用CIVET流程提取皮质厚度、皮质表面积和局部脑回指数指标。通过正交投影非负矩阵分解（OPNMF），我们识别出整合皮质厚度、表面积和局部脑回指数的非重叠空间成分，并捕捉这些特征间的结构协变。随后采用行为偏最小二乘相关（bPLS）分析计算OPNMF协变模式的个体差异与受试者ExF结果的相关性。研究纳入56名3岁前接受体外循环手术的CHD青年和56名年龄性别匹配的健康对照。分析显示CHD患者的皮质灰质体积、厚度和表面积均显著低于对照组。OPNMF识别出12个稳定的全皮质成分，概括了皮质厚度、表面积和局部脑回指数的个体间变异。bPLS分析揭示两个显著潜在变量（LV），共解释样本82.8%的变异，分别描述大脑与认知数据的不同关联模式。LV1呈现CHD组归属、多数BRIEF-A量表评分较差、MRI检查年龄较小及女性性别的特征模式，该模式与多个OPNMF成分中皮质厚度和局部脑回指数增加、表面积减少相关。最后我们发现CHD组中LV1脑-行为模式与主动脉阻断总时间呈正相关，表明更长的主动脉阻断时间与更差的神经心理结局相关。本研究通过数据驱动方法，首次揭示了CHD青少年和年轻成人ExF与皮质厚度、表面积及局部脑回指数改变的新型多变量关系。尽管结果凸显了皮质在高级认知过程中的重要作用，但未来仍需进一步阐明个体特征和临床因素对该人群缺陷的具体影响机制。 | 40800383 | Medical Image Analysis |
| ACID: A comprehensive toolbox for image processing and modeling of brain, spinal cord, and ex vivo diffusion MRI data. | ACID：一个全面的工具箱，用于大脑、脊髓及离体扩散MRI数据的图像处理与建模。 | David Gergely, Fricke Björn, Oeschger Jan Malte, Ruthotto Lars, Fritz Francisco J et al. | Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.) (2024) | Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has become a crucial imaging technique in the field of neuroscience, with a growing number of clinical applications. Although most studies still focus on the brain, there is a growing interest in utilizing dMRI to investigate the healthy or injured spinal cord. The past decade has also seen the development of biophysical models that link MR-based diffusion measures to underlying microscopic tissue characteristics, which necessitates validation through ex vivo dMRI measurements. Building upon 13 years of research and development, we present an open-source, MATLAB-based academic software toolkit dubbed ACID:A Comprehensive Toolbox forImage Processing and Modeling of Brain, Spinal Cord, and Ex VivoDiffusion MRI Data. ACID is an extension to the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software, designed to process and model dMRI data of the brain, spinal cord, and ex vivo specimens by incorporating state-of-the-art artifact correction tools, diffusion and kurtosis tensor imaging, and biophysical models that enable the estimation of microstructural properties in white matter. Additionally, the software includes an array of linear and nonlinear fitting algorithms for accurate diffusion parameter estimation. By adhering to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) data organization principles, ACID facilitates standardized analysis, ensures compatibility with other BIDS-compliant software, and aligns with the growing availability of large databases utilizing the BIDS format. Furthermore, being integrated into the popular SPM framework, ACID benefits from a wide range of segmentation, spatial processing, and statistical analysis tools as well as a large and growing number of SPM extensions. As such, this comprehensive toolbox covers the entire processing chain from raw DICOM data to group-level statistics, all within a single software package. | 扩散磁共振成像(dMRI)已成为神经科学领域的关键成像技术，临床应用日益广泛。尽管大多数研究仍集中于大脑，但利用dMRI研究健康或受损脊髓的兴趣正逐渐增长。过去十年间，连接磁共振扩散测量与微观组织特征的生物物理模型也得到发展，这需要通过离体dMRI测量进行验证。基于13年的研发积累，我们推出名为ACID的开源MATLAB学术软件工具包：一个用于脑部、脊髓及离体扩散MRI数据处理与建模的综合工具箱。ACID作为统计参数图(SPM)软件的扩展，通过整合前沿伪影校正工具、扩散与峰度张量成像技术以及可估算白质微观结构特性的生物物理模型，专为处理脑部、脊髓及离体样本的dMRI数据而设计。该软件还包含一系列线性和非线性拟合算法，以实现精确的扩散参数估计。ACID遵循脑成像数据结构(BIDS)标准，不仅支持标准化分析、确保与其他BIDS兼容软件的互操作性，还能适配日益增多的采用BIDS格式的大型数据库。此外，作为流行SPM框架的组成部分，ACID可共享SPM丰富的分割、空间处理与统计分析工具，并能兼容不断增长的SPM扩展模块。这款综合工具箱覆盖了从原始DICOM数据到群体统计的完整处理流程，所有功能均集成于单一软件包中。 | 40800336 | Medical Image Analysis |

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4o in interpreting radiological imaging, specifically X-ray, CT, and MRI images, across various organ systems and disease types. Methods A total of 377 cases were collected and presented to GPT-4o with a standardized prompt and no clinical context. The responses were assessed by three independent raters using a five-point rating system. Results X-ray imaging exhibited a 2.21 times higher chance, on average, of being interpreted accurately compared to CT scans (odds ratio (OR): 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33 - 3.69), while pelvic imaging had a 6.25 times lower chance, on average, of being interpreted accurately when compared to images of the abdomen (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.56). Additionally, neoplastic conditions had a 2.7 times lower chance, on average, of being interpreted accurately compared to bleeding conditions (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.84). Conclusion A bimodal distribution of median ratings highlights an overreliance on comparability to prior image encounters and emphasizes the need to develop a systematic approach to image analysis. Future research should prioritize eliminating hallucination, establishing standardized evaluation criteria, and exploring methods to integrate visual and text-based data in a balanced manner. Additionally, efforts should be directed towards enhancing dataset diversity to improve the model's overall accuracy and generalizability. | 引言 人工智能（AI）作为医疗决策支持系统在放射学中的应用，有望提升诊断准确性并改善患者预后。本研究通过回顾性分析，旨在评估GPT-4o在解读不同器官系统和疾病类型的X光、CT及MRI影像时的诊断能力。方法 共收集377例病例，采用标准化提示词且不提供临床背景的情况下输入GPT-4o。由三位独立评审员采用五分制评分系统对回答进行评估。结果 与CT扫描相比，X光影像的准确解读概率平均高出2.21倍（比值比[OR]：2.21；95%置信区间[CI]：1.33-3.69）；而与腹部影像相比，盆腔影像的准确解读概率平均低6.25倍（OR：0.16；95%CI：0.02-0.56）。此外，肿瘤性病变的准确解读概率平均比出血性病变低2.7倍（OR：0.37；95%CI：0.16-0.84）。结论 评分中位数的双峰分布表明模型过度依赖与既往影像的对比性，亟需建立系统化的影像分析方法。未来研究应重点消除幻觉现象、制定标准化评估标准，并探索视觉与文本数据的均衡整合方法。同时需增强数据集多样性，以提升模型的整体准确性和泛化能力。 | 40799875 | Medical Image Analysis |

| An imaging genetics network model for clinical score assessment in Alzheimer's disease. | 阿尔茨海默病临床评分评估的影像遗传学网络模型。 | Sheng Jinhua, Xin Yu, Zhang Qiao, Wang Luyun, Wang Binbing | PNAS nexus (2025) | Imaging genomics has recently emerged as a prominent focus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, showing great potential in predicting and diagnosing. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream imaging genetics network (DS-IGN) approach to AD clinical score assessment. DS-IGN is composed of two branches: one processes longitudinal data (neuroimaging) and the other handles static data (gene information). The imaging branch leverages hypergraphs to capture high-order relationships, constructing hypergraphs for samples and image features and performing weighted fusion. The genetic branch introduces an attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the weights of different genetic loci, which is particularly effective when multiple genes interact. By integrating both imaging and genetic features, DS-IGN effectively predicts patients' clinical scores in advance, providing early warnings of cognitive decline and supporting timely interventions to slow disease progression. | 影像基因组学已成为阿尔茨海默病（AD）研究的重要方向，在预测与诊断方面展现出巨大潜力。本文提出一种双流影像遗传网络（DS-IGN）用于AD临床评分评估。该网络包含两个分支：一支处理纵向数据（神经影像），另一支处理静态数据（基因信息）。影像分支采用超图捕捉高阶关联，通过构建样本超图与特征超图进行加权融合；基因分支引入注意力机制自适应调节不同基因位点权重，对多基因交互场景尤为有效。通过融合影像与遗传特征，DS-IGN能提前预测患者临床评分，为认知衰退提供早期预警，助力及时干预以延缓病情发展。 | 40799348 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Limited predictive value of pretreatment P-glycoprotein immunostaining for chemotherapy efficacy and survival in long-follow-up osteosarcoma patients. | 预处理P-糖蛋白免疫染色对长期随访骨肉瘤患者化疗效果及生存的预测价值有限。 | Higuchi Takashi, Igarashi Kentaro, Miwa Shinji, Takeuchi Akihiko, Hayashi Katsuhiro et al. | Medicine (2025) | The clinical utility of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in osteosarcoma remains controversial. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the association between P-gp expression and clinicopathological factors, chemotherapy (CTx) response, and prognosis in osteosarcoma. Twenty-three osteosarcoma patients treated at our institution between 2007 and 2013 were included. P-gp expression rate was measured by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis. CTx response was evaluated by image evaluation (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria) and pathological evaluation (Rosen and Huvos classification). The association between P-gp expression rate and clinicopathological factors, CTx response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) was statistically analyzed. The P-gp expression rates ranged from 1.7% to 67.9% (mean 46.0%). No significant association was found between P-gp expression rate and surgical stage, CTx response, or clinical outcome. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an optimal P-gp cutoff value of 47.0% for predicting poor CTx response, with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 67%. When patients were divided into P-gp positive (n = 13) and negative (n = 10) groups based on the 47.0% cutoff value, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of surgical stage, CTx response, OS, and DFS. Although the P-gp positive group showed a trend towards worse OS and DFS, no statistically significant differences were observed (OS: P = .73, DFS: P = .32). P-gp expression in osteosarcoma was not significantly associated with surgical stage, CTx response, or prognosis. These findings suggest that P-gp may not be a useful biomarker for CTx selection or prognosis prediction in osteosarcoma. | P-糖蛋白（P-gp）在骨肉瘤中的临床价值仍存在争议。这项回顾性队列研究旨在探讨P-gp表达与骨肉瘤患者临床病理特征、化疗反应及预后的关联。研究纳入2007至2013年间本院收治的23例骨肉瘤患者，通过诊断时活检标本的免疫组化染色测定P-gp表达率。化疗反应采用影像学评估（实体瘤疗效评价标准）和病理学评估（Rosen-Huvos分级）进行判定。通过统计学分析P-gp表达率与临床病理特征、化疗反应、无病生存期（DFS）及总生存期（OS）的关系。结果显示P-gp表达率为1.7%-67.9%（均值46.0%），与手术分期、化疗反应及临床结局均无显著相关性。受试者工作特征曲线分析显示，预测化疗反应不良的最佳P-gp临界值为47.0%（敏感性73%，特异性67%）。按此临界值将患者分为P-gp阳性组（n=13）与阴性组（n=10）后，两组在手术分期、化疗反应、OS及DFS方面均无显著差异。尽管P-gp阳性组呈现OS与DFS更差的趋势，但无统计学意义（OS：P=0.73；DFS：P=0.32）。研究表明骨肉瘤中P-gp表达与手术分期、化疗反应及预后均无显著关联，提示P-gp可能无法作为骨肉瘤化疗方案选择或预后预测的有效生物标志物。 | 40797473 | Medical Image Analysis |
| An animal model study of simplified optical navigation system-assisted percutaneous lumbar transforaminal puncture. | 简化光学导航系统辅助经皮腰椎椎间孔穿刺的动物模型研究。 | Chai B N Wenxiu, Chen Yuqing, Sheng Li, Huang Yong | Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research (2025) | Optical navigation systems can provide real-time visualization of the positional relationship between surgical instruments and patient anatomy, making them suitable for assisting in puncture localization during percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). However, current research on optically-navigated puncture localization during PTED is still limited, with high equipment costs and complex operational techniques being the main barriers to widespread adoption. 3D Slicer is a powerful open-source medical image analysis and visualization platform that can be integrated with external optical trackers to construct a low-cost optical navigation system for assisted puncture procedures. This study aims to develop a simplified optical navigation system based on an optical tracker and 3D Slicer software, and to evaluate its effectiveness in assisting percutaneous lumbar foraminal puncture through animal model experiments. | 光学导航系统能够实时可视化手术器械与患者解剖结构之间的位置关系，使其适用于经皮椎间孔镜髓核摘除术（PTED）中辅助穿刺定位。然而，目前关于PTED术中光学导航穿刺定位的研究仍较为有限，高昂的设备成本和复杂的操作技术是阻碍其广泛应用的主要障碍。3D Slicer作为一款功能强大的开源医学图像分析与可视化平台，可与外部光学跟踪器集成构建低成本的光学导航系统用于辅助穿刺操作。本研究旨在开发一套基于光学跟踪器与3D Slicer软件的简易光学导航系统，并通过动物模型实验评估其在辅助经皮腰椎间孔穿刺中的效果。 | 40797346 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Precise, predictable genome integrations by deep-learning-assisted design of microhomology-based templates. | 通过深度学习辅助设计基于微同源模板实现精确、可预测的基因组整合。 | Naert Thomas, Yamamoto Taiyo, Han Shuting, Röck Ruth, Horn Melanie et al. | Nature biotechnology (2025) | Precise CRISPR-based DNA integration and editing remain challenging, largely because of insufficient control of the repair process. We find that repair at the genome-cargo interface is predictable by deep learning models and adheres to sequence-context-specific rules. On the basis of in silico predictions, we devised a strategy of base-pair tandem repeat repair arms matching microhomologies at double-strand breaks. These repeat homology arms promote frame-retentive cassette integration and reduce deletions both at the target site and within the transgene. We demonstrate precise integrations at 32 loci in HEK293T cells. Germline-transmissible transgene integration and endogenous protein tagging in Xenopus and adult mouse brains demonstrated precise integration during early embryonic cleavage and in nondividing, differentiated cells. Optimized repair arms also facilitated small edits for scarless single-nucleotide or double-nucleotide changes using oligonucleotide templates in vitro and in vivo. We provide the design tool Pythia to facilitate precise genomic integration and editing for experimental and therapeutic purposes for a wide range of target cell types and applications. | 基于CRISPR的精确DNA整合与编辑仍具挑战性，主要源于对修复过程的控制不足。我们发现，通过深度学习模型可预测基因组-载体界面的修复行为，其遵循特定序列背景的规则。基于计算机预测，我们设计了一种碱基对串联重复修复臂策略，使其与双链断裂处的微同源区相匹配。这些重复同源臂能促进框架保留型盒式整合，并减少目标位点及转基因内部的缺失。我们在HEK293T细胞中实现了32个位点的精确整合。非洲爪蟾种系可遗传转基因整合与成年小鼠脑内源蛋白标记实验表明，该技术可在早期胚胎卵裂期和非分裂分化细胞中实现精确整合。优化后的修复臂还能通过寡核苷酸模板在体外和体内实现无疤痕的单核苷酸或双核苷酸微小编辑。我们提供设计工具Pythia，旨在为各类靶细胞和应用场景的实验与治疗目的，实现精确的基因组整合与编辑。 | 40796977 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Glymphatic system dysfunction correlated with gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. | 精神分裂症中类淋巴系统功能障碍与肠道菌群失调及认知损害相关。 | Wu Hui, Liu Bingdong, Liu Weiyin Vivian, Wen Zhi, Yang Wenbing et al. | Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany) (2025) | Structural and functional brain abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ) are well-documented, yet the role of the glymphatic system remains largely unexplored. Given emerging evidence linking the microbiome-gut-brain axis to SZ, this study aims to investigate the glymphatic system function in SZ patients using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) and to explore its associations with gut microbiota and cognitive performance. Multi-omics data were obtained from a cohort of 87 SZ patients and 70 healthy controls (HCs), including fecal 16S rRNA sequencing, DTI-ALPS index analysis, and cognitive assessments. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships among the gut microbiome, DTI-ALPS index, and cognitive performance. Compared to HCs, patients with SZ exhibited significantly lower DTI-ALPS indices in the left, right, and bilateral hemispheres. These indices were positively associated with multiple cognitive domains. In addition, gut microbial dysbiosis was observed in SZ, characterized by a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in pathogenic bacteria. Exploratory analyses further revealed a tripartite link among the key microbial genera, DTI-ALPS indices, and cognitive performance. Notably, the higher abundance of Proteus as well as the lower abundance of Blautia and Faecalibacterium may contribute to poorer cognitive performance, potentially through disruptions in the right DTI-ALPS index. These findings provide novel insights into glymphatic dysfunction in SZ and highlight a potential microbiota-glymphatic-cognition pathway contributing to cognitive impairments. | 精神分裂症（SZ）患者的大脑结构和功能异常已有充分记录，但类淋巴系统的功能仍鲜有研究。鉴于微生物-肠-脑轴与精神分裂症关联的新证据，本研究旨在通过血管周围间隙扩散张量成像分析（DTI-ALPS）探究患者类淋巴系统功能，并分析其与肠道菌群及认知功能的关联。研究采集了87名SZ患者和70名健康对照（HCs）的多组学数据，包括粪便16S rRNA测序、DTI-ALPS指数分析和认知评估，通过相关性分析和中介效应分析探讨肠道菌群、DTI-ALPS指数与认知功能的关系。结果显示，与HCs相比，SZ患者左右侧及双侧大脑半球的DTI-ALPS指数均显著降低，且该指数与多项认知功能呈正相关。此外，患者肠道菌群呈现失调特征，表现为产丁酸盐菌减少而致病菌增多。探索性分析进一步揭示了关键菌属、DTI-ALPS指数与认知功能的三元关联：变形菌属丰度升高，而布劳特氏菌属和粪杆菌属丰度降低，可能通过右侧DTI-ALPS指数受损导致认知功能下降。这些发现为理解SZ的类淋巴功能障碍提供了新视角，并揭示了一条可能通过"微生物群-类淋巴-认知"通路导致认知损伤的潜在机制。 | 40796779 | Medical Image Analysis |
| A non-sub-sampled shearlet transform-based deep learning sub band enhancement and fusion method for multi-modal images. | 一种基于非下采样剪切波变换的深度学习子带增强与多模态图像融合方法。 | Sengan Sudhakar, Gugulothu Praveen, Alroobaea Roobaea, Webber Julian L, Mehbodniya Abolfazl et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | Multi-Modal Medical Image Fusion (MMMIF) has become increasingly important in clinical applications, as it enables the integration of complementary information from different imaging modalities to support more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The primary objective of Medical Image Fusion (MIF) is to generate a fused image that retains the most informative features from the Source Images (SI), thereby enhancing the reliability of clinical decision-making systems. However, due to inherent limitations in individual imaging modalities-such as poor spatial resolution in functional images or low contrast in anatomical scans-fused images can suffer from information degradation or distortion. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel fusion framework that integrates the Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for effective sub-band enhancement and image reconstruction. Initially, each source image is decomposed into Low-Frequency Coefficients (LFC) and multiple High-Frequency Coefficients (HFC) using NSST. The proposed Concurrent Denoising and Enhancement Network (CDEN) is then applied to these sub-bands to suppress noise and enhance critical structural details. The enhanced LFCs are fused using an AlexNet-based activity-level fusion model, while the enhanced HFCs are combined using a Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) guided by a Novel Sum-Modified Laplacian (NSML) metric. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed via Inverse-NSST (I-NSST). Experimental results prove that the proposed method outperforms existing fusion algorithms, achieving approximately 16.5% higher performance in terms of the QAB/F (edge preservation) metric, along with strong results across both subjective visual assessments and objective quality indices. | 多模态医学图像融合（MMMIF）在临床应用中日益重要，它能够整合不同成像模态的互补信息，为更精准的诊断和治疗规划提供支持。医学图像融合（MIF）的核心目标是生成保留源图像（SI）中最具信息量特征的融合图像，从而提升临床决策系统的可靠性。然而，由于单一成像模态的固有局限——例如功能图像空间分辨率不足或解剖扫描对比度低——融合图像可能出现信息退化或失真。为解决这些问题，本研究提出一种新型融合框架，将非下采样剪切波变换（NSST）与卷积神经网络（CNN）相结合，实现有效的子带增强与图像重建。首先，通过NSST将每幅源图像分解为低频系数（LFC）和多个高频系数（HFC）；随后采用提出的并发去噪增强网络（CDEN）处理这些子带以抑制噪声并强化关键结构细节。增强后的低频系数通过基于AlexNet的活性度融合模型进行融合，而增强后的高频系数则采用新型改进拉普拉斯和（NSML）指标引导的脉冲耦合神经网络（PCNN）进行整合。最终通过逆NSST（I-NSST）重建融合图像。实验证明，该方法在边缘保留指标QAB/F上性能提升约16.5%，同时在主观视觉评估和客观质量指标中均表现出显著优势，综合性能优于现有融合算法。 | 40796770 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Singletrome enhances detection of long noncoding RNAs in single cell transcriptomes. | 单细胞转录组中长链非编码RNA的检测通过Singletrome得到增强。 | Rahman Raza Ur, Ahmad Iftikhar, Li Zixiu, Sparks Robert P, Ben Saad Amel et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of gene expression in individual cell types, but scRNA-seq studies have focused primarily on expression of protein-coding genes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are more diverse than protein-coding genes, yet remain underexplored in part because they are underrepresented in reference annotations applied to scRNA-seq. Merging annotations containing protein-coding and lncRNA genes is not sufficient, because the addition of lncRNA genes that overlap in sense and antisense with protein-coding genes will affect how reads are counted for both protein-coding and lncRNA genes. Here, we introduce Singletrome, a Singularity image that integrates protein-coding and lncRNA gene transfer format (GTF) annotations to generate enhanced annotations that take into account the sense and antisense overlap of annotated genes, maps scRNA-seq data, and produces files for downstream analysis and visualization. With Singletrome, we detected thousands of lncRNAs not included in GENCODE, clustered cell types based solely on lncRNA expression, and demonstrated that machine learning can predict cell type and disease through lncRNAs alone. This comprehensive annotation will allow mapping of lncRNA expression across cell types of the human body, facilitating the development of an atlas of human lncRNAs in health and disease with the ability to integrate new lncRNA annotations as they become available. | 单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）技术彻底改变了对单个细胞类型中基因表达的研究，但现有研究主要聚焦于蛋白质编码基因的表达。长链非编码RNA（lncRNA）比蛋白质编码基因更具多样性，却仍未得到充分探索，部分原因是现有scRNA-seq参考注释中对它们的覆盖不足。简单合并包含蛋白质编码基因和lncRNA的注释并不够，因为新增与蛋白质编码基因存在正反义重叠的lncRNA会影响两者的读数统计。为此，我们开发了Singletrome——一个整合蛋白质编码基因与lncRNA基因转移格式（GTF）注释的Singularity镜像工具，它能生成考虑基因正反义重叠关系的增强注释，映射scRNA-seq数据，并产出用于下游分析和可视化的文件。通过Singletrome，我们检测到数千个未收录于GENCODE的lncRNA，仅基于lncRNA表达就实现了细胞类型聚类，并证明机器学习可仅通过lncRNA预测细胞类型和疾病状态。这种综合注释将助力绘制人体各类细胞中lncRNA的表达图谱，推动建立涵盖健康与疾病状态的人类lncRNA图谱，并能在新lncRNA注释发布时实现无缝整合。 | 40796606 | Medical Image Analysis |

A tear of the superior bundle of the lateral ligament complex has been proposed as a contributor to micro-instability, potentially causing increased anterior translation and internal talar rotation under load. Weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) offers valuable insight into hindfoot alignment and load-induced deformation, making it a promising tool for assessing suspected micro-instability. This study aims to compare talar axial rotation between symptomatic patients reporting subjective micro-instability and asymptomatic controls. | 诊断机械性慢性踝关节不稳（CAI）通常较为直接，但识别细微的微不稳仍具挑战性。外侧韧带复合体上束的撕裂被认为是导致微不稳的因素之一，可能在负重时引发距骨前移增加和内旋。负重计算机断层扫描（WBCT）能有效评估后足对位及负荷引起的形变，使其成为评估疑似微不稳的有力工具。本研究旨在比较主诉主观微不稳的有症状患者与无症状对照者之间的距骨轴向旋转差异。 | 40796476 | Medical Image Analysis |

Moreover, key considerations for development of AI algorithms in medical image analysis are discussed. AI presents a potential breakthrough in real-time, objective and rapid endoscopic assessment, with implications for predicting disease progression. It is anticipated that, by harmonising multimodal data, AI will transform patient care through early diagnosis, accurate patient profiling and therapeutic response prediction. The ability of AI in cross-sectional medical imaging to improve diagnostic accuracy, automate and enable objective assessment of disease activity and predict clinical outcomes highlights its transformative potential. AI models have consistently outperformed traditional methods of image interpretation, particularly in complex areas such as differentiating IBD subtypes, identifying disease progression and complications. The use of AI in histology is a particularly dynamic research field. Implementation of AI algorithms in clinical practice is still lagging, a major hurdle being the lack of a digital workflow in many pathology institutes. Adoption is likely to start with implementation of automatic disease activity scoring. Beyond matching pathologist performance, algorithms may teach us more about IBD pathophysiology. While AI is set to substantially advance IBD diagnostics, various challenges such as heterogeneous datasets, retrospective designs and assessment of different endpoints must be addressed. Implementation of novel standards of reporting may drive an increase in research quality and overcome these obstacles. | 本文综述了人工智能（AI）在炎症性肠病（IBD）内镜、放射学和组织学诊断领域的研究现状，并探讨了医学影像分析中AI算法开发的关键要素。AI有望实现实时、客观且快速的内镜评估突破，对预测疾病进展具有重要意义。通过整合多模态数据，AI将推动早期诊断、精准患者分型和治疗反应预测，从而变革患者诊疗模式。AI在医学影像分析中展现的提升诊断准确性、实现疾病活动度自动化客观评估及预测临床结局的能力，凸显了其变革潜力。AI模型在图像判读方面持续超越传统方法，尤其在区分IBD亚型、识别疾病进展和并发症等复杂领域表现突出。组织学领域的AI应用是当前最活跃的研究方向之一。尽管AI算法在临床实践中的应用仍显滞后——许多病理机构缺乏数字化工作流程是主要障碍，但自动疾病活动度评分有望成为率先落地的应用场景。这些算法不仅能媲美病理学家水平，还可能为IBD病理生理机制研究提供新见解。虽然AI将显著推动IBD诊断发展，但仍需解决数据集异质性、回顾性研究设计和多样化终点评估等挑战。实施新型研究报告标准有望提升研究质量并突破这些障碍。 | 40796218 | Medical Image Analysis |

| CXR-LT 2024: A MICCAI challenge on long-tailed, multi-label, and zero-shot disease classification from chest X-ray. | CXR-LT 2024：一项基于胸部X光的长尾、多标签及零样本疾病分类的MICCAI挑战赛。 | Lin Mingquan, Holste Gregory, Wang Song, Zhou Yiliang, Wei Yishu et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT 2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45 disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for chest radiography. | CXR-LT系列是一个社区驱动的项目，旨在通过胸部X光片（CXR）提升肺部疾病分类能力。该项目致力于解决开放长尾肺部疾病分类中的难题，并增强前沿技术的可衡量性。首届活动CXR-LT 2023通过提供高质量基准CXR数据用于模型开发，并进行全面评估以识别影响肺部疾病分类性能的现存问题，从而实现这些目标。基于CXR-LT 2023的成功，CXR-LT 2024将数据集扩展至377,110张胸部X光片和45种疾病标签，其中包括19种新增罕见病征。活动还新增了对零样本学习的关注，以解决上一届活动中发现的局限性。具体而言，CXR-LT 2024包含三项任务：（i）在大型含噪声测试集上进行长尾分类，（ii）在人工标注的"黄金标准"子集上进行长尾分类，（iii）对五种未见疾病征象的零样本泛化。本文概述了CXR-LT 2024，详细说明了数据整理流程，并整合了前沿解决方案，包括使用多模态模型检测罕见疾病、采用先进生成方法处理噪声标签，以及针对未见疾病的零样本学习策略。此外，扩展后的数据集增强了疾病覆盖范围，能更好反映真实临床场景，为未来研究提供宝贵资源。通过综合参赛团队的见解与创新，我们旨在推动胸部放射学诊断模型向临床实用性和泛化能力发展。 | 40795541 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Comparison of rectal and bladder dose between retractor insertion and gauze packing in intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer. | 宫颈癌腔内近距离治疗中牵开器插入与纱布填塞对直肠和膀胱剂量的比较。 | Osaki Noriko, Soyano Takashi, Sutani Shinya, Matsumoto Hideki, Takeda Atsuya et al. | Journal of radiation research (2025) | This study aimed to compare and verify the rectal and bladder doses of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) using both rectal retractor (RR) and gauze packing (GP) in the same patients. A total of 37 patients who underwent ICBT using RR and GP for cervical cancer were included in this study. Rectal and bladder dose and volume data were compared with the RR and GP treatments in the same patients and the confounding factors were examined. When comparing RR and GP, the median and interquartile ranges for rectal D2cc were 2.8 (2.5-3.7) Gy with RR and 3.2 (2.7-3.8) Gy with GP. The median bladder D2cc was 4.9 (4.5-6.3) Gy with RR and 4.8 (3.9-5.4) Gy with GP. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that rectal doses were significantly lower with RR (P = 0.02), whereas bladder doses were significantly higher with RR (P < 0.001). Analysis of the correlation between the number of gauze pieces and the difference in rectal D2cc between GP and RR using Pearson's distribution revealed no significant correlation (R = -0.20, P = 0.22), as well as bladder D2cc between GP and RR also revealed no significant correlation (R = -0.20, P = 0.22). The number of gauze pieces did not necessarily correlate with a reduction in the rectal and bladder dose. In conclusion, rectal D2cc was lower with RR in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer, whereas bladder D2cc was higher with RR than with GP. | 本研究旨在比较并验证同一患者群体中，使用直肠牵开器（RR）与纱布填塞（GP）进行腔内近距离放射治疗（ICBT）时直肠与膀胱的受照剂量差异。共纳入37例接受RR与GP治疗的宫颈癌ICBT患者，对比分析两种方法在相同患者中的直肠、膀胱剂量与体积数据，并探讨混杂因素的影响。结果显示：RR组与GP组的直肠D2cc中位数（四分位距）分别为2.8（2.5-3.7）Gy和3.2（2.7-3.8）Gy；膀胱D2cc中位数分别为4.9（4.5-6.3）Gy（RR组）和4.8（3.9-5.4）Gy（GP组）。Wilcoxon符号秩检验表明，RR组直肠剂量显著更低（P=0.02），而膀胱剂量显著更高（P<0.001）。通过Pearson相关性分析发现，纱布使用数量与GP/RR间直肠D2cc差异（R=-0.20，P=0.22）及膀胱D2cc差异（R=-0.20，P=0.22）均无显著相关性，表明纱布数量未必能降低直肠与膀胱受量。结论指出，在图像引导的宫颈癌近距离治疗中，RR可降低直肠D2cc，但其膀胱D2cc高于GP方案。 | 40794896 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Design of on-chip coded X-ray sensors for high-confidence super-resolution radiological imaging. | 用于高置信度超分辨率放射成像的片上编码X射线传感器设计。 | Mao Tianyi, Wang Lei, Jiang Yuqi, Ma Xu, Zhu Shujin et al. | Applied optics (2025) | Robustness and confidence are crucial in super-resolution tasks for X-ray radiological imaging, both in terms of X-ray sensors and image processing techniques. Due to the extremely short wavelengths of X-rays, optical modulation in X-ray imaging systems is highly challenging. Consequently, single-image super-resolution techniques in computer vision have become a popular approach in medical imaging. However, these methods can lead to artifacts and the plasticity phenomenon, potentially compromising image quality and diagnostic accuracy. In this manuscript, we introduce an on-chip coded aperture design that is both cost-effective and helps overcome the additional constraints and limitations commonly found in traditional computational-imaging-based super-resolution X-ray systems. This design generates sub-pixel physical coding on X-ray sensors, and thus a three-dimensional (3D) computational decoding approach is presented that transforms the two-dimensional (2D) super-resolution reconstruction into a 3D compressed sensing problem. Unlike super-resolution restoration in computer vision, this problem can be mathematically solved to yield interpretable reconstructions under the constraints of the restricted isometry property. Our experimental results, complemented by qualitative analysis, demonstrate the superiority of our design in X-ray radiological imaging, effectively mitigating artifacts and the "plastic-like" appearance frequently associated with conventional super-resolution techniques. | 在X射线放射成像的超分辨率任务中，无论是X射线传感器还是图像处理技术，鲁棒性和置信度都至关重要。由于X射线波长极短，X射线成像系统中的光学调制极具挑战性。因此，计算机视觉中的单图像超分辨率技术已成为医学成像领域的流行方法。然而，这些方法可能导致伪影和"塑料感"现象，可能影响图像质量和诊断准确性。本文提出了一种经济高效的片上编码孔径设计，有助于克服传统基于计算成像的超分辨率X射线系统中常见的额外约束和限制。该设计在X射线传感器上生成亚像素物理编码，进而提出一种三维（3D）计算解码方法，将二维（2D）超分辨率重建转化为3D压缩感知问题。与计算机视觉中的超分辨率复原不同，该问题可在受限等距性质的约束下通过数学方法求解，获得可解释的重建结果。实验数据结合定性分析表明，我们的设计在X射线放射成像中具有优越性，能有效缓解传统超分辨率技术常见的伪影和"塑料感"现象。 | 40793439 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Head-mounted displays based on human eye condition variation patterns. | 基于人眼状态变化模式的头戴式显示器。 | Cao Tuo, Wang Lingyun, Yan Shenghu, Gong Shijie | Journal of the Optical Society of America. A, Optics, image science, and vision (2025) | In response to the practical demands for a wide field of view (FOV), long exit pupil distance, and high image quality in head-mounted displays, an initial structure was built based on the principles of catadioptric lenses in a folded optical path (pancake optics) and the field curvature correction formula. Subsequently, using even-order aspheric surfaces, a VR optical system was developed with a FOV of 2w=110∘, an exit pupil distance of 15 mm, and an exit pupil diameter of 8 mm. Compared to traditional designs, a human eye model was introduced as the image plane to construct a VR-human eye optical system analysis model, allowing for direct analysis of the retinal image quality under different states of the human eye. After that, based on medical statistical data, the impact of different light intensity conditions on the retinal image quality of the VR optical system was explored. Experimental results showed that changes in light intensity affect the pupil diameter, which, in turn, influences the final image quality of the system. To solve the issues, two solutions were proposed: adjusting the screen distance and changing the lens spacing. Both methods significantly improved the imaging quality on the human retina, with an increase of over 30% in the average MTF value. A comparison of these methods was conducted, providing valuable references for future VR optical system designs. | 针对头戴显示设备对大视场、长出瞳距、高成像质量的现实需求，首先基于折反式折叠光路（pancake）透镜原理与场曲校正公式搭建初始结构，随后采用偶次非球面设计出一款视场角2w=110∘、出瞳距离15mm、出瞳直径8mm的VR光学系统。与传统设计相比，引入人眼模型作为像面，构建VR-人眼光学系统分析模型，可直接分析不同人眼状态下的视网膜成像质量。之后基于医学统计数据，探究不同光强条件对VR光学系统视网膜成像质量的影响。实验结果表明，光强变化会影响瞳孔直径，进而影响系统最终成像质量。针对问题提出两种解决方案：调整屏幕距离与改变透镜间距。两种方法均显著改善了人眼视网膜上的成像质量，平均MTF值提升30%以上，并对两种方法进行了对比，为今后VR光学系统设计提供了有益参考。 | 40793313 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Enhanced MRI brain tumor detection using deep learning in conjunction with explainable AI SHAP based diverse and multi feature analysis. | 利用深度学习结合基于可解释AI SHAP的多样化多特征分析增强MRI脑肿瘤检测。 | Rahman Asif, Hayat Maqsood, Iqbal Nadeem, Alarfaj Fawaz Khaled, Alkhalaf Salem et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | Recent innovations in medical imaging have markedly improved brain tumor identification, surpassing conventional diagnostic approaches that suffer from low resolution, radiation exposure, and limited contrast. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is pivotal in precise and accurate tumor characterization owing to its high-resolution, non-invasive nature. This study investigates the synergy among multiple feature representation schemes such as local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Gray-Level Run Length Matrix alongside five learning algorithms namely: k-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and probabilistic neural network (PNN), and CNN. Empirical findings indicate that LBP in conjunction with SVC and CNN obtained high specificity and accuracy, rendering it a promising method for MRI-based tumor diagnosis. Further to investigate the contribution of LBP, Statistical analysis chi-square and p-value tests are used to confirm the significant impact of LBP feature space for identification of brain Tumor. In addition, The SHAP analysis was used to identify the most important features in classification. In a small dataset, CNN obtained 97.8% accuracy while SVC yielded 98.06% accuracy. In subsequent analysis, a large benchmark dataset is also utilized to evaluate the performance of learning algorithms in order to investigate the generalization power of the proposed model. CNN achieves the highest accuracy of 98.9%, followed by SVC at 96.7%. These results highlight CNN's effectiveness in automated, high-precision tumor diagnosis. This achievement is ascribed with MRI-based feature extraction by combining high resolution, non-invasive imaging capabilities with the powerful analytical abilities of CNN. CNN demonstrates superiority in medical imaging owing to its ability to learn intricate spatial patterns and generalize effectively. This interaction enhances the accuracy, speed, and consistency of brain tumor detection, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery. https://github.com/asifrahman557/BrainTumorDetection . | 医学影像技术的最新进展显著提升了脑肿瘤识别的准确性，超越了传统诊断方法分辨率低、存在辐射且对比度有限的局限。磁共振成像(MRI)凭借其高分辨率与非侵入性特性，成为实现精准肿瘤诊断的关键技术。本研究探索了局部二值模式(LBP)、Gabor滤波器、离散小波变换、快速傅里叶变换、卷积神经网络(CNN)和灰度游程矩阵等多种特征表示方法，结合k近邻、随机森林、支持向量分类器(SVC)、概率神经网络(PNN)和CNN五种学习算法的协同效应。实验结果表明，LBP结合SVC与CNN的方案具有高特异性和准确率，为基于MRI的肿瘤诊断提供了可靠方法。通过卡方检验与p值测试验证了LBP特征空间对脑肿瘤识别的显著贡献，并采用SHAP分析确定分类关键特征。在小规模数据集中，CNN取得97.8%准确率，SVC达98.06%。后续采用大型基准数据集验证模型泛化能力时，CNN以98.9%准确率领先，SVC为96.7%。这些成果凸显了CNN在高精度自动化肿瘤诊断中的优势，其成功归因于将MRI高分辨率非侵入成像与CNN强大的空间模式学习能力相结合。CNN通过捕捉复杂医学影像特征并保持优异泛化性能，显著提升了脑肿瘤检测的准确性、速度和一致性，为改善患者预后与医疗效率提供了新途径。项目代码详见https://github.com/asifrahman557/BrainTumorDetection。 | 40790336 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Ethical considerations and robustness of artificial neural networks in medical image analysis under data corruption. | 数据损坏情况下医学图像分析中人工神经网络的伦理考量与稳健性。 | Okunev Michael, Handelman Doron, Handelman Amir | Scientific reports (2025) | Medicine is one of the most sensitive fields in which artificial intelligence (AI) is extensively used, spanning from medical image analysis to clinical support. Specifically, in medicine, where every decision may severely affect human lives, the issue of ensuring that AI systems operate ethically and produce results that align with ethical considerations is of great importance. In this work, we investigate the combination of several key parameters on the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) used for medical image analysis in the presence of data corruption or errors. For this purpose, we examined five different ANN architectures (AlexNet, LeNet 5, VGG16, ResNet-50, and Vision Transformers - ViT), and for each architecture, we checked its performance under varying combinations of training dataset sizes and percentages of images that are corrupted through mislabeling. The image mislabeling simulates deliberate or nondeliberate changes to the dataset, which may cause the AI system to produce unreliable results. We found that the five ANN architectures produce different results for the same task, both for cases with and without dataset modification, which implies that the selection of which ANN architecture to implement may have ethical aspects that need to be considered. We also found that label corruption resulted in a mixture of performance metrics tendencies, indicating that it is difficult to conclude whether label corruption has occurred. Our findings demonstrate the relation between ethics in AI and ANN architecture implementation and AI computational parameters used therefor, and raise awareness of the need to find appropriate ways to determine whether label corruption has occurred. | 医学是人工智能（AI）应用最敏感的领域之一，涵盖从医学影像分析到临床支持的广泛场景。尤其在医疗决策可能深刻影响人类生命的背景下，确保AI系统符合伦理规范并产出道德兼容的结果至关重要。本研究探讨了数据损坏或错误存在时，多项关键参数组合对医学影像分析人工神经网络（ANN）性能的影响。我们测试了五种ANN架构（AlexNet、LeNet 5、VGG16、ResNet-50和视觉变换器ViT），针对每种架构评估了不同训练数据集规模与错误标注图像比例组合下的表现。图像错误标注模拟了数据集遭受有意或无意的篡改，这些篡改可能导致AI系统产生不可靠结果。研究发现：五种ANN架构在相同任务中（无论数据集是否被修改）均呈现差异化表现，这意味着架构选择本身可能涉及需要考量的伦理维度；标签损坏会导致性能指标呈现混杂变化趋势，使得难以判定是否发生了标签污染。我们的发现揭示了AI伦理与ANN架构实现及计算参数之间的关联，并警示业界需要寻找合适方法来检测标签污染的发生。 | 40790201 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Self-supervised disc and cup segmentation via non-local deformable convolution and adaptive transformer. | 通过非局部可变形卷积与自适应变换器的自监督视盘和视杯分割。 | Zhao Wenbo, Wang Yu | SLAS technology (2025) | Optic disc and cup segmentation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, playing a pivotal role in automated pathological image analysis. It enables precise, efficient, and automated diagnosis of ocular conditions, significantly aiding clinicians in real-world medical applications. However, due to the scarcity of medical segmentation data and the insufficient integration of global contextual information, the segmentation accuracy remains suboptimal. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in optic disc and cup cases with complex anatomical structures and ambiguous boundaries. In order to address these limitations, this paper introduces a self-supervised training strategy integrated with a newly designed network architecture to improve segmentation accuracy. Specifically,we initially propose a non-local dual deformable convolutional block,which aims to capture the irregular image patterns(i.e. boundary). Secondly,we modify the traditional vision transformer and design an adaptive K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) transformation block to extract the global semantic context from images. Finally,an initialization strategy based on self-supervised training is proposed to reduce the burden on the network on labeled data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms previous networks and achieves state-of-the-art performance,with IOU scores of 0.9577 for the optic disc and 0.8399 for the optic cup on the REFUGE dataset. | 视盘与视杯分割是计算机视觉领域的重要分支，在自动化病理图像分析中发挥着关键作用。该技术能实现精准、高效、自动化的眼部疾病诊断，为临床医生的实际医疗工作提供重要支持。然而由于医学分割数据稀缺及全局上下文信息整合不足，现有分割精度仍不理想，这一难题在解剖结构复杂、边界模糊的视盘视杯案例中尤为突出。为突破这些局限，本文提出结合自监督训练策略与新设计网络架构的方案以提升分割精度。具体而言，我们首先提出非局部双可变形卷积模块，旨在捕捉图像中的不规则模式（如边界区域）；其次改进传统视觉Transformer架构，设计自适应K近邻变换模块以提取图像的全局语义上下文；最后提出基于自监督训练的初始化策略以降低网络对标注数据的依赖。综合实验评估表明，所提方法在REFUGE数据集上以视盘0.9577、视杯0.8399的IOU分数超越现有网络，达到最先进性能。 | 40789537 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Dendrite cross attention for high-dose-rate brachytherapy distribution planning. | 高剂量率近距离放射治疗分布规划的树突交叉注意力。 | Saini Sourav, Liu Xiaofeng | Computers in biology and medicine (2025) | Cervical cancer is a significant global health issue, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) is crucial for its treatment. However, manually creating HDR-BT plans is time-consuming and heavily relies on the planner's expertise, making standardization difficult. This study introduces two advanced deep learning models to address this need: Bi-branch Cross-Attention UNet (BiCA-UNet) and Dendrite Cross-Attention UNet (DCA-UNet). BiCA-UNet enhances the correlation between the CT scan and segmentation maps of the clinical target volume (CTV), applicator, bladder, and rectum. It uses two branches: one processes the stacked input of CT scans and segmentations, and the other focuses on the CTV segmentation. A cross-attention mechanism integrates these branches, improving the model's understanding of the CTV region for accurate dose predictions. Building on BiCA-UNet, DCA-UNet further introduces a primary branch of stacked inputs and three secondary branches for CTV, bladder, and rectum segmentations forming a dendritic structure. Cross attention with bladder and rectum segmentation helps the model understand the regions of organs at risk (OAR), refining dose prediction. Evaluation of these models using multiple metrics indicates that both BiCA-UNet and DCA-UNet significantly improve HDR-BT dose prediction accuracy for various applicator types. The cross-attention mechanisms enhance the feature representation of critical anatomical regions, leading to precise and reliable treatment plans. This research highlights the potential of BiCA-UNet and DCA-UNet in advancing HDR-BT planning, contributing to the standardization of treatment plans, and offering promising directions for future research to improve patient outcomes in the source data. | 宫颈癌是全球重大健康问题，而高剂量率近距离放射治疗（HDR-BT）是其治疗关键。但人工制定HDR-BT计划耗时且高度依赖规划者经验，难以实现标准化。本研究针对这一需求引入两种先进深度学习模型：双分支交叉注意力UNet（BiCA-UNet）与树突交叉注意力UNet（DCA-UNet）。BiCA-UNet通过双分支架构增强CT扫描与临床靶区（CTV）、施源器、膀胱及直肠分割图间的关联性：一支处理CT扫描与分割图的堆叠输入，另一支专注CTV分割。交叉注意力机制融合双分支特征，提升模型对CTV区域的理解以实现精准剂量预测。在BiCA-UNet基础上，DCA-UNet进一步构建堆叠输入的主干分支，以及CTV、膀胱、直肠分割组成的树突状次级分支。通过膀胱直肠分割的交叉注意力，模型能更好理解危及器官区域从而优化剂量预测。多指标评估表明，两种模型对不同施源器类型的HDR-BT剂量预测精度均有显著提升。交叉注意力机制强化了关键解剖区域的特征表征，可生成精确可靠的治疗方案。本研究揭示了BiCA-UNet与DCA-UNet在推进HDR-BT规划标准化方面的潜力，为改善患者预后提供了未来研究方向。 | 40789235 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Thermographic Insights into Degenerative Spinal Disorders: Evaluating the Diagnostic Potential of Digital Infrared Thermography Imaging. | 《退行性脊柱疾病的热成像观察：评估数字红外热成像技术的诊断潜力》 | Muthu Sathish, Kalanchiam Guna Pratheep, Shyam Ashok | Journal of orthopaedic case reports (2025) | Degenerative spinal disorders are a growing concern, affecting millions worldwide and often leading to chronic pain, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life. Traditional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans primarily focus on structural abnormalities, limiting real-time physiological assessments. Digital infrared thermography imaging (DITI) has emerged as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool that evaluates thermal emissions from the body, offering valuable insights into musculoskeletal dysfunction. This review explores the principles of DITI, its application in diagnosing degenerative spinal disorders, and its clinical implications. DITI operates on the principle that physiological disturbances - such as inflammation, neuropathy, and vascular irregularities -alter skin temperature distribution, which can be captured using infrared technology. It has shown promise in detecting conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and facet joint degeneration by identifying abnormal thermal asymmetry. While DITI offers advantages such as real-time functional assessment, cost-effectiveness, and early disease detection, challenges related to standardization, environmental variability, and specificity persist. Recent advancements, including artificial intelligence-driven thermal analysis and hybrid imaging approaches, are improving DITI's diagnostic precision and clinical utility. Establishing standardized protocols for environmental control, patient preparation, and image validation is crucial for ensuring reproducibility in spinal evaluations. As research progresses, integrating DITI with conventional imaging methods may enhance its role in clinical practice, optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes for patients with degenerative spinal disorders. | 退行性脊柱疾病日益受到关注，全球数百万人受其影响，常导致慢性疼痛、功能障碍和生活质量下降。传统成像技术如磁共振成像和计算机断层扫描主要关注结构异常，限制了实时生理评估。数字红外热成像技术（DITI）作为一种非侵入性诊断工具崭露头角，通过评估人体热辐射为肌肉骨骼功能障碍提供重要信息。本文综述了DITI的工作原理、在退行性脊柱疾病诊断中的应用及其临床意义。DITI基于生理紊乱（如炎症、神经病变和血管异常）会改变皮肤温度分布的原理，这些变化可通过红外技术捕捉。该技术在检测椎间盘突出、椎管狭窄和小关节退变等病症方面展现出潜力，主要通过识别异常热不对称性实现。尽管DITI具有实时功能评估、成本效益和早期疾病检测等优势，但在标准化、环境变异性和特异性方面仍存在挑战。人工智能驱动的热分析和混合成像技术等最新进展正提升DITI的诊断精度和临床实用性。建立环境控制、患者准备和图像验证的标准化方案对确保脊柱评估的可重复性至关重要。随着研究深入，将DITI与传统成像技术结合有望增强其临床应用价值，为退行性脊柱疾病患者优化诊断准确性和治疗效果。 | 40786782 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Visualized breath-hold training for reducing respiratory motion artifacts in liver dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. | 可视化屏气训练减少肝脏动态增强磁共振成像中的呼吸运动伪影。 | Luo Xin, Chen Gen, Zhang Shufeng, Hu Xuemei, Huang Chao | Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery (2025) | Liver dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a critical role in detecting hepatic lesions but is highly susceptible to respiratory motion artifacts. Although advancements in rapid magnetic resonance (MR) acquisition techniques have been made, breath-hold acquisitions are predominantly used for abdominal DCE-MRI due to their superior image quality. Therefore, prescan breath-hold training is essential to improving patients' compliance and minimizing respiratory artifacts. Traditional oral training methods, which rely on operators monitoring chest/abdominal movement, are subjective and often insufficient for DCE-MRI requirements, leading to suboptimal image quality and potential risks from repeated contrast administration. To address these limitations, we developed a novel visual breath-hold training instrument and evaluated its efficacy in reducing respiratory artifacts. | 肝脏动态对比增强磁共振成像（DCE-MRI）在检测肝脏病变中起着关键作用，但极易受到呼吸运动伪影的影响。尽管快速磁共振（MR）采集技术已取得进展，但由于其更优的图像质量，屏气采集仍是腹部DCE-MRI的主要方法。因此，预扫描屏气训练对于提高患者配合度、减少呼吸伪影至关重要。传统的口头训练方法依赖操作者观察胸腹部运动，具有主观性，往往难以满足DCE-MRI的要求，导致图像质量不佳，并可能因重复注射对比剂带来风险。为解决这些局限性，我们开发了一种新型视觉屏气训练装置，并评估了其在减少呼吸伪影方面的效果。 | 40785901 | Medical Image Analysis |

Accurate intraoperative assessment of septal morphology, SAM distance, and LVOT area (LVOTa) is critical for surgical planning during septal myectomy. While transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), particularly with three-dimensional (3D) imaging, is the standard modality for evaluating these parameters, it may be contraindicated or suboptimal in select cases. Real-time 3D epicardial echocardiography (EE) offers an alternative imaging approach that allows direct visualization of the heart intraoperatively without esophageal instrumentation. This study investigates the utility of 3D EE compared to 3D TEE for quantitative assessment of septal left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), SAM distance, and LVOTa in HOCM patients undergoing myectomy. The primary aim is to assess whether 3D EE and TEE measurements correlate and can be used interchangeably.

| Cytogenotoxic Activity of Gadoteric Acid in SH-SY5Y Cells and XIAP Interaction With Molecular Docking. | 钆特酸在SH-SY5Y细胞中的细胞遗传毒性作用及XIAP分子对接研究。 | Bilgin Batuhan, Husunet Mehmet Tahir, Kenger Ibrahim Halil | Journal of applied toxicology : JAT (2025) | Gadoteric acid is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) used to improve image quality in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although it is also used in the diagnosis and prognosis of neuroblastoma, its effect on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells remains unclear as a scientific gap. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gadoteric acid on cytogenotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and its affinity with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). After treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with gadoteric acid (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mM), cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. After determining the IC50 value of gadoteric acid, the DNA damage effect of gadoteric acid (3.35, 6.7, 13.47, and 26.84 mM) on SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by Comet assay. Molecular docking analysis was carried out to identify the binding affinity of gadoteric acid to XIAP. Gadoteric acid (10 and 100 mM) significantly increased cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Gadoteric acid (3.35, 6.7, 13.47, and 26.84 mM) caused a statistically significant increase in Genetic Damage Index (GDI) level in SH-SY5Y cells (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Gadoteric acid (13.47 and 26.84 mM) also significantly increased the Damaged Cell Index (DCI) level in neuroblastoma cells (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). The results of our study indicate that gadoteric acid used in MRI shows a cytogenotoxic effect on neuroblastoma cells and binds to XIAP with high affinity. These findings may provide insight into the use of gadoteric acid in the treatment of neuroblastoma and the molecular apoptosis mechanism of gadoteric acid. | 钆特酸是一种钆基对比剂（GBCA），用于提升磁共振成像（MRI）的图像质量。尽管它也用于神经母细胞瘤的诊断和预后评估，但其对SH-SY5Y神经母细胞瘤细胞的作用仍存在科学空白。本研究旨在探讨钆特酸对SH-SY5Y神经母细胞瘤细胞的细胞遗传毒性及其与X连锁凋亡抑制蛋白（XIAP）的亲和力。用钆特酸（0.1、1、10和100 mM）处理SH-SY5Y细胞后，通过3-(4,5-二甲基噻唑-2-基)-2,5-二苯基-2H-四唑溴化物（MTT）法评估细胞活力。在确定钆特酸的IC50值后，通过彗星实验研究钆特酸（3.35、6.7、13.47和26.84 mM）对SH-SY5Y细胞的DNA损伤效应。通过分子对接分析确定钆特酸与XIAP的结合亲和力。钆特酸（10和100 mM）显著增加了神经母细胞瘤细胞的细胞毒性（分别为p < 0.0001和p < 0.0001）。钆特酸（3.35、6.7、13.47和26.84 mM）在SH-SY5Y细胞中显著提高了遗传损伤指数（GDI）水平（分别为p < 0.01、p < 0.05、p < 0.0001和p < 0.001）。钆特酸（13.47和26.84 mM）还显著增加了神经母细胞瘤细胞的损伤细胞指数（DCI）水平（分别为p < 0.01和p < 0.01）。我们的研究结果表明，MRI中使用的钆特酸对神经母细胞瘤细胞表现出细胞遗传毒性效应，并与XIAP具有高亲和力结合。这些发现可能为钆特酸在神经母细胞瘤治疗中的应用及其分子凋亡机制提供新的见解。 | 40784725 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Artificial intelligence with feature fusion empowered enhanced brain stroke detection and classification for disabled persons using biomedical images. | 基于特征融合的人工智能技术利用生物医学图像增强对残疾人士脑卒中的检测与分类。 | Alsieni Mohammed, Alyoubi Khaled H | Scientific reports (2025) | Brain stroke is an illness which affects almost every age group, particularly people over 65. There are two significant kinds of strokes: ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Blockage of brain vessels causes an ischemic stroke, while cracks in blood vessels in or around the brain cause a hemorrhagic stroke. In the prompt analysis of brain stroke, patients can live an easier life. Recognizing strokes using medical imaging is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Conversely, access to innovative imaging methods is restricted, particularly in emerging states, so it is challenging to analyze brain stroke cases of disabled people appropriately. Hence, the development of more accurate, faster, and more reliable diagnostic models for the timely recognition and efficient treatment of ischemic stroke is greatly needed. Artificial intelligence technologies, primarily deep learning (DL), have been widely employed in medical imaging, utilizing automated detection methods. This paper presents an Enhanced Brain Stroke Detection and Classification using Artificial Intelligence with Feature Fusion Technologies (EBSDC-AIFFT) model. This paper aims to develop an enhanced brain stroke detection system for individuals with disabilities, utilizing biomedical images to improve diagnostic accuracy. Initially, the image pre-processing stage involves various steps, including resizing, normalization, data augmentation, and data splitting, to enhance image quality. In addition, the EBSDC-AIFFT model combines the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, the convolutional block attention module-ResNet18 method, and the multi-axis vision transformer technique for feature extraction. Finally, the variational autoencoder (VAE) model is implemented for the classification process. The performance validation of the EBSDC-AIFFT technique is performed under the brain stroke CT image dataset. The comparison study of the EBSDC-AIFFT technique demonstrated a superior accuracy value of 99.09% over existing models. | 脑中风是一种几乎影响所有年龄段的疾病，尤其是65岁以上人群。中风主要有两种类型：缺血性和出血性。脑血管阻塞导致缺血性中风，而脑内或周围血管破裂则引发出血性中风。通过及时分析脑中风，患者可以更轻松地生活。利用医学影像识别中风对于早期诊断和治疗规划至关重要。然而，创新成像方法的应用受限，尤其在新兴国家，这使得对残障人士的中风病例进行恰当分析颇具挑战。因此，亟需开发更精准、快速且可靠的诊断模型，以实现缺血性中风的及时识别和有效治疗。人工智能技术，尤其是深度学习（DL），已通过自动化检测方法广泛应用于医学影像领域。本文提出了一种基于人工智能与特征融合技术的增强型脑中风检测与分类（EBSDC-AIFFT）模型，旨在利用生物医学图像为残障人士开发增强型脑中风检测系统，以提高诊断准确性。首先，图像预处理阶段包括调整大小、归一化、数据增强和数据分割等步骤以提升图像质量。此外，EBSDC-AIFFT模型结合了Inception-ResNet-v2模型、卷积块注意力模块-ResNet18方法和多轴视觉变换器技术进行特征提取。最后，采用变分自编码器（VAE）模型进行分类处理。EBSDC-AIFFT技术的性能验证在脑中风CT图像数据集上进行，对比研究表明该技术的准确率高达99.09%，优于现有模型。 | 40783612 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Risk factors for prolonged hospitalization in acute decompensated heart failure from the HEROES study. | 来自HEROES研究的急性失代偿性心力衰竭患者住院时间延长的风险因素。 | Lucki Mateusz, Mitkowski Przemysław, Lucka Ewa, Grygier Marek, Straburzyńska-Migaj Ewa et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | This study, part of the HEROES project (HEart failure Risk factOrs and patiEnt Stratification), aimed to identify clinical, laboratory, functional, and treatment-related factors associated with hospitalization duration (above and below 8 days) in patients admitted for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We analyzed 562 Caucasian patients hospitalized due to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), divided into two groups based on length of stay (LOS): ≤ 8 days (n = 287; 51.07%) and > 8 days (n = 275; 48.93%). In the ≤ 8 days group, 203 patients (70.73%) were male, while in the > 8 days group, 202 patients (73.45%) were male. Data on sociodemographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment details, and patient-reported health status (KCCQ-12) were collected. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of prolonged hospitalization. Patients with longer LOS had higher NYHA class (p < 0.001), greater comorbidity burden (p = 0.0019), longer intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) stay (p < 0.001), and higher in-hospital mortality (p = 0.0006). They also showed elevated NT-proBNP (p < 0.0001), procalcitonin (p = 0.03), and creatinine (p = 0.0002), and lower hemoglobin (p = 0.004), hematocrit (p = 0.014), and sodium (p = 0.0325). In the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of prolonged hospitalization included treatment with norepinephrine (OR = 18.41), dopamine (OR = 8.62), and oral iron therapy (OR = 3.25). Conversely, protective factors associated with a reduced risk of prolonged hospitalization were higher KCCQ-12 scores (OR = 0.98), higher systolic blood pressure at admission (OR = 0.99), and prior statin use (OR = 0.56).

| Value of artificial intelligence in neuro-oncology. | 人工智能在神经肿瘤学中的价值。 | Voigtlaender Sebastian, Nelson Thomas A, Karschnia Philipp, Vaios Eugene J, Kim Michelle M et al. | The Lancet. Digital health (2025) | CNS cancers are complex, difficult-to-treat malignancies that remain insufficiently understood and mostly incurable, despite decades of research efforts. Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape neuro-oncological practice and research, driving advances in medical image analysis, neuro-molecular-genetic characterisation, biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, tailored management strategies, and neurorehabilitation. This Review examines key opportunities and challenges associated with AI applications along the neuro-oncological care trajectory. We highlight emerging trends in foundation models, biophysical modelling, synthetic data, and drug development and discuss regulatory, operational, and ethical hurdles across data, translation, and implementation gaps. Near-term clinical translation depends on scaling validated AI solutions for well defined clinical tasks. In contrast, more experimental AI solutions offer broader potential but require technical refinement and resolution of data and regulatory challenges. Addressing both general and neuro-oncology-specific issues is essential to unlock the full potential of AI and ensure its responsible, effective, and needs-based integration into neuro-oncological practice. | 中枢神经系统癌症是一类复杂且难以治疗的恶性肿瘤，尽管经过数十年的研究，人们对其认识仍不充分，多数病例仍无法治愈。人工智能（AI）正在重塑神经肿瘤学的临床实践与研究，推动医学影像分析、神经分子遗传学特征分析、生物标志物发现、治疗靶点识别、个体化管理策略及神经康复等领域的进步。本综述探讨了AI在神经肿瘤诊疗全流程应用中的关键机遇与挑战，重点分析了基础模型、生物物理建模、合成数据及药物研发等新兴趋势，并剖析了数据、转化与实施环节中的监管、操作及伦理障碍。短期内临床转化的关键在于针对明确临床任务扩展已验证的AI解决方案，而更具实验性的AI技术虽潜力广泛，仍需技术优化并解决数据与监管难题。只有兼顾普适性问题与神经肿瘤学特殊需求，才能充分释放AI潜力，确保其负责任、有效且基于实际需求地融入神经肿瘤学实践。 | 40783350 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Artificial intelligence in forensic neuropathology: A systematic review. | 法医神经病理学中的人工智能：系统综述。 | Treglia Michele, La Russa Raffaele, Napoletano Gabriele, Ghamlouch Alessandro, Del Duca Fabio et al. | Journal of forensic and legal medicine (2025) | In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained prominence as a robust tool for clinical decision-making and diagnostics, owing to its capacity to process and analyze large datasets with high accuracy. More specifically, Deep Learning, and its subclasses, have shown significant potential in image processing, including medical imaging and histological analysis. In forensic pathology, AI has been employed for the interpretation of histopathological data, identifying conditions such as myocardial infarction, traumatic injuries, and heart rhythm abnormalities.

| STARFormer: A novel spatio-temporal aggregation reorganization transformer of FMRI for brain disorder diagnosis. | STARFormer：一种用于脑障碍诊断的新型fMRI时空聚合重组Transformer。 | Dong Wenhao, Li Yueyang, Zeng Weiming, Chen Lei, Yan Hongjie et al. | Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society (2025) | Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a spatio-temporal aggregation reorganization transformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The official implementation codes are available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer. | 许多现有利用功能磁共振成像（fMRI）对自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）和注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）等脑部疾病进行分类的方法，往往忽略了血氧水平依赖（BOLD）信号的空间与时间依赖性的整合，这可能导致分类结果不准确或不精确。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种时空聚合重组变换器（STARFormer），通过整合三个关键模块有效捕捉BOLD信号的空间和时间特征。感兴趣区（ROI）空间结构分析模块利用特征向量中心性（EC）基于有效连接重组脑区，突显与脑部疾病相关的关键空间关系；时间特征重组模块将时间序列系统分割为等维窗口标记，并通过可变窗口与跨窗口注意力捕获多尺度特征；时空特征融合模块采用并行变换器架构，配备专用时间和空间分支以提取融合特征。所提出的STARFormer已在两个公开数据集上针对ASD和ADHD分类任务进行了严格评估，实验结果证实其以多项评估指标达到最先进性能，为脑部疾病诊断和生物医学研究提供了更精准可靠的工具。官方实现代码详见：https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer。 | 40782662 | Medical Image Analysis |
| OCELOT 2023: Cell detection from cell-tissue interaction challenge. | OCELOT 2023：细胞-组织交互作用挑战中的细胞检测任务。 | Shin JaeWoong, Ryu Jeongun, Puche Aaron Valero, Lee Jinhee, Brattoli Biagio et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge. | 病理学家在检查全切片图像时，通常会交替使用不同的放大倍数，以便评估广泛的组织形态和复杂的细胞细节，从而形成全面的诊断。然而，现有的基于深度学习的细胞检测模型难以复制这些行为，也无法学习不同放大倍数下结构之间的相互依赖语义。该领域的一个关键障碍是缺乏具有多尺度重叠细胞和组织注释的数据集。OCELOT 2023挑战赛的发起旨在汇集社区的见解，以验证理解细胞与组织（细胞-组织）相互作用对于实现人类水平性能至关重要的假设，并加速该领域的研究。挑战赛数据集包含来自六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割注释，共计673对样本，源自306张癌症基因组图谱（TCGA）的苏木精和伊红染色全切片图像，分为训练、验证和测试子集。参赛者提出的模型显著增强了对细胞-组织关系的理解。与未纳入细胞-组织关系的基线纯细胞模型相比，测试集上表现最佳的参赛模型F1分数提高了7.99。这是对传统纯细胞检测方法的重大性能改进，证明了将多尺度语义纳入模型的必要性。本文对参赛者使用的方法进行了比较分析，重点介绍了OCELOT 2023挑战赛中实施的创新策略。 | 40782597 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Clinical insights to improve medical deep learning design: A comprehensive review of methods and benefits. | 提升医学深度学习设计的临床洞见：方法及益处的全面综述。 | Thornblad Terese A E, Ewals Lotte J S, Nederend Joost, Luyer Misha D P, De With Peter H N et al. | Computers in biology and medicine (2025) | The success of deep learning and computer vision of natural images has led to an increased interest in medical image deep learning applications. However, introducing black-box deep learning models leaves little room for domain-specific knowledge when making the final diagnosis. For medical computer vision applications, not only accuracy, but also robustness, interpretability and explainability are essential to ensure trust for clinicians. Medical deep learning applications can therefore benefit from insights into the application at hand by involving clinical staff and considering the clinical diagnostic process. In this review, different clinically-inspired methods are surveyed, including clinical insights used at different stages of deep learning design for three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) image data. This review is conducted by investigating 400 research articles, covering different deep learning-based approaches for diagnosis of different diseases, in terms of including clinical insights in the published work. Based on this, a further detailed review is conducted of the 47 scientific articles using clinical inspiration. The clinically-inspired methods were found to be made with respect to preparation for training, 3D medical image data processing, integration of clinical data and model architecture selection and development. This highlights different ways in which domain-specific knowledge can be used in the design of deep learning systems. | 深度学习和自然图像计算机视觉的成功引发了人们对医学图像深度学习应用的日益关注。然而，引入黑盒深度学习模型在为最终诊断提供空间时，却很少能融入特定领域的专业知识。对于医学计算机视觉应用而言，不仅需要准确性，还需具备鲁棒性、可解释性和可说明性，以确保临床医生的信任。因此，通过让临床人员参与并考虑临床诊断过程，医学深度学习应用可以从对当前应用的深入理解中获益。本综述调查了多种临床启发的方法，包括在三维（3D）计算机断层扫描（CT）图像数据的深度学习设计不同阶段所使用的临床见解。这项综述通过研究400篇研究文章完成，涵盖了基于深度学习的多种疾病诊断方法，重点关注这些已发表工作中对临床见解的纳入。在此基础上，进一步详细审查了47篇采用临床启发的科学文章。研究发现，临床启发的方法主要体现在训练准备、3D医学图像数据处理、临床数据整合以及模型架构选择与开发等方面。这突显了在深度学习系统设计中运用领域特定知识的不同途径。 | 40782553 | Medical Image Analysis |

This review explores AI's potential to support dentists in identifying systemic diseases and conditions, such as skin cancer, autism spectrum disorder, hypertension, diabetes, halitosis, osteoporosis and carotid artery calcification, during routine dental care. It highlights the role of AI-based technologies in early detection and improved patient outcomes.Methods A literature search was conducted via PubMed, Google Scholar and an extensive hand search. Eligible publications were those that reported on novel AI applications for early systemic disease detection and which could be employed in the dental setting. Three researchers independently conducted research for relevant literature and extracted the data. Studies were included in consensus.Results In total, 42 eligible articles were included and their findings were summarised. Applications included AI-driven image analysis for skin cancer and tongue colour changes in diabetes, breath analysis for halitosis-linked conditions, and radiographic detection of calcifications and osteoporosis. The reviewed studies demonstrated that AI exhibits significant potential in improving diagnostic accuracy for systemic diseases observable during dental examinations, enabling timely referrals and interventions and improved healthcare integration.Conclusion The findings suggest that AI can assist dentists in identifying systemic diseases beyond oral health concerns. Integrating AI-driven diagnostic tools into routine dental care has the potential to enhance early detection of systemic conditions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes.

| Medical application driven content based medical image retrieval system for enhanced analysis of X-ray images. | 医疗应用驱动的基于内容的医学图像检索系统，用于增强X光图像分析。 | Saranya E, Chinnadurai M | Scientific reports (2025) | By carefully analyzing latent image properties, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems are able to recover pertinent images without relying on text descriptions, natural language tags, or keywords related to the image. This search procedure makes it quite easy to automatically retrieve images in huge, well-balanced datasets. However, in the medical field, such datasets are usually not available. This study proposed an advanced DL technique to enhance the accuracy of image retrieval in complex medical datasets. The proposed model can be integrated into five stages, namely pre-processing, decomposing the images, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification with an image retrieval mechanism. The hybridized Wavelet-Hadamard Transform (HWHT) was utilized to obtain both low and high frequency detail for analysis. In order to extract the main characteristics, the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) was employed. Furthermore, to minimize feature complexity, Sine chaos based artificial rabbit optimization (SCARO) was utilized. By employing the Bhattacharyya Coefficient for improved similarity matching, the Bhattacharya Context performance aware global attention-based Transformer (BCGAT) improves classification accuracy.

| Recurrent inference machine for medical image registration. | 用于医学图像配准的循环推理机。 | Zhang Yi, Zhao Yidong, Xue Hui, Kellman Peter, Klein Stefan et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | Image registration is essential for medical image applications where alignment of voxels across multiple images is needed for qualitative or quantitative analysis. With recent advances in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modeling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver for the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input. We extensively evaluated RIIR on brain MRI, lung CT, and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only 5% of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration. | 图像配准在医学影像应用中至关重要，当需要对多幅图像的体素进行对齐以进行定性或定量分析时，这一技术不可或缺。随着深度神经网络和并行计算的最新进展，基于深度学习的医学图像配准方法凭借其灵活的建模能力和快速推理优势展现出竞争力。然而与传统基于优化的配准方法相比，这种速度优势可能以牺牲推理时的配准性能为代价。此外，深度神经网络理想情况下需要大量训练数据集，而基于优化的方法无需训练。为提升配准精度和数据效率，我们提出了一种新型图像配准方法——循环推理图像配准（RIIR）网络。RIIR被构建为以迭代方式解决配准问题的元学习求解器，通过学习优化更新规则，将隐式正则化与显式梯度输入相结合，从而解决精度和数据效率问题。我们在脑部MRI、肺部CT和定量心脏MRI数据集上对RIIR的配准精度和训练数据效率进行了全面评估。实验表明，即使仅使用5%的训练数据，RIIR仍优于一系列深度学习方法，展现出卓越的数据效率。消融研究的关键发现揭示了循环推理框架中引入的隐藏状态对元学习的重要增值作用。我们提出的RIIR为基于深度学习的医学图像配准提供了一个高度数据高效的框架。 | 40779833 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Learning from certain regions of interest in medical images via probabilistic positive-unlabeled networks. | 通过概率性正未标记网络从医学图像的特定感兴趣区域学习。 | Yi Le, Zhang Lei, Zhao Kefu, Xu Xiuyuan | Medical image analysis (2025) | The laborious annotation process and inherent image ambiguity exacerbate difficulties of data acquisition for medical image segmentation, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. This paper proposes a workaround against these challenges aiming to learn unbiased models solely from certainties. Concretely, during the labeling stage, only regions of interest confidently discerned by annotators are required to be labeled, not only increasing label quantity but also improving label quality. This approach formulates the positive-unlabeled (PU) segmentation problem and motivates to capture uncertainty in ambiguous regions. We thus delve into data-generating assumptions in the PU segmentation context and propose Probabilistic PU Segmentation Networks (ProPU-Nets) to tackle problems abovementioned. This framework employs the expectation-maximization algorithm to gradually estimate true masks, and more importantly, by encoding plausible segmentation variants in a latent space, uncertainty estimation can be naturally embedded into the PU segmentation framework. Benefitting from the framework's unbiasedness, a semi-supervised PU segmentation method is also proposed, which can further excavate performance gains from unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on LIDC, RIGA, and LA datasets, and comprehensively compared with state-of-the-art methods in label-efficient medical image segmentation. The results justify the method's effectiveness and practical prospect. | 医学图像分割的数据获取因繁琐的标注过程和图像固有的模糊性而面临巨大挑战，导致实际应用效果欠佳。本文提出一种创新解决方案，旨在仅通过确定性区域学习无偏模型。具体而言，标注阶段仅要求标注者标记可明确识别的感兴趣区域，此举既增加了标注数量又提升了标注质量。该方法构建了正例-未标注（PU）分割问题框架，并致力于捕捉模糊区域的不确定性。为此，我们深入探究了PU分割场景下的数据生成假设，提出概率化PU分割网络（ProPU-Nets）以解决上述问题。该框架采用期望最大化算法逐步估计真实掩模，更重要的是，通过在潜在空间编码合理分割变体，不确定性估计可自然嵌入PU分割框架。得益于该框架的无偏特性，本文还提出半监督PU分割方法，能够从未标注数据中进一步挖掘性能提升潜力。我们在LIDC、RIGA和LA数据集上进行了大量实验，并与标签高效医学图像分割领域的先进方法进行全面对比，结果验证了该方法的有效性和应用前景。 | 40779832 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Interpretable multi-scale deep learning to detect malignancy in cell blocks and cytological smears of pleural effusion and identify aggressive endometrial cancer. | 可解释的多尺度深度学习用于检测胸水细胞块和细胞涂片中的恶性病变并识别侵袭性子宫内膜癌。 | Wang Ching-Wei, Muzakky Hikam, Chung Yu-Pang, Lai Po-Jen, Chao Tai-Kuang | Medical image analysis (2025) | The pleura is a serous membrane that surrounds the surface of the lungs. The visceral surface secretes fluid into the serous cavity, while the parietal surface ensures that the fluid is properly absorbed. However, when this balance is disrupted, it leads to the formation of pleural Effusion. The most common malignant pleural effusion (MPE) caused by lung cancer or breast cancer, and benign pleural effusions (BPE) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, heart failure, or infections related to pneumonia. Today, with the rapid advancement of treatment protocols, accurately diagnosing MPE has become increasingly important. Although cytology smears and cell blocks examinations of pleural effusion are the clinical gold standards for diagnosing MPE, the diagnostic accuracy of these tools can be affected by certain limitations, such as low sensitivity, diagnostic variability across different regions and significant inter-observer variability, leading to a certain proportion of misdiagnoses. This study presents a deep learning (DL) framework, namely Interpretable Multi-scale Attention DL with Self-Supervised Learning Feature Encoder (IMA-SSL), to identifyMPE or BPE using 194 Cytological smears whole-slide images (WSIs) and 188 cell blocks WSIs. The use of DL on WSIs of pleural effusion allows for preliminary results to be obtained in a short time, giving patients the opportunity for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The experimental results show that the proposed IMA-SSL consistently obtained superior performance and outperformed five state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in malignancy prediction on both cell block and cytological smear datasets and also in identification of aggressive endometrial cancer (EC) using a public TCGA dataset. Fisher's exact test confirmed a highly significant correlation between the outputs of the proposed model and the slide status in the EC and pleural effusion datasets (p < 0.001), substantiating the model's predictive reliability. The proposed method has the potential for practical clinical application in the foreseeable future. It can directly detect the presence of malignant tumor cells from cost-effective cell blocks and pleural effusion cytology smears and facilitate personalized cancer treatment decisions. | 胸膜是覆盖在肺表面的浆膜，脏层分泌液体进入浆膜腔，而壁层确保液体被正常吸收。一旦这种平衡被打破，就会形成胸腔积液。最常见的恶性胸腔积液（MPE）由肺癌或乳腺癌引发，而良性胸腔积液（BPE）则由结核分枝杆菌感染、心力衰竭或肺炎相关感染导致。在治疗方案快速发展的今天，准确诊断MPE变得愈发重要。尽管胸腔积液的细胞学涂片和细胞块检查是临床诊断MPE的金标准，但这些工具的诊断准确性可能受限于灵敏度低、地区间诊断差异及观察者间显著差异等因素，导致一定比例的误诊。本研究提出了一种深度学习（DL）框架——可解释多尺度注意力DL结合自监督学习特征编码器（IMA-SSL），利用194张细胞学涂片全切片图像（WSIs）和188张细胞块WSIs来区分MPE或BPE。将DL应用于胸腔积液WSIs可在短时间内获得初步结果，为患者争取更早的诊断和治疗时机。实验结果表明，所提出的IMA-SSL在细胞块和细胞学涂片数据集上的恶性肿瘤预测中表现优异，优于五种先进（SOTA）方法，并在使用公共TCGA数据集识别侵袭性子宫内膜癌（EC）时同样表现出色。Fisher精确检验证实，该模型输出与EC及胸腔积液数据集中的切片状态高度相关（p < 0.001），验证了模型的预测可靠性。该方法有望在不久的将来投入实际临床应用，可直接从经济高效的细胞块和胸腔积液细胞学涂片中检测恶性肿瘤细胞的存在，助力个性化癌症治疗决策。 | 40779831 | Medical Image Analysis |
| MedCLIP-SAMv2: Towards universal text-driven medical image segmentation. | MedCLIP-SAMv2：迈向通用文本驱动的医学图像分割。 | Koleilat Taha, Asgariandehkordi Hojat, Rivaz Hassan, Xiao Yiming | Medical image analysis (2025) | Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathologies in medical images is essential for modern disease diagnosis, clinical research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing robust segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is an active field of research. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks with SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels in a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive validation across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/MedCLIP-SAMv2. | 医学图像中解剖结构与病变的分割对于现代疾病诊断、临床研究和治疗规划至关重要。尽管基于深度学习的分割技术已取得重大进展，但许多方法仍存在数据效率、泛化性和交互性方面的局限。因此，开发需要更少标注数据的鲁棒分割方法仍是医学图像分析中的关键挑战。近期，CLIP和Segment-Anything-Model（SAM）等具有强大跨域表征能力的基础模型的出现，为交互式和通用图像分割开辟了新途径。然而，如何进一步探索这些模型在医学影像中实现数据高效分割仍是活跃的研究领域。本文提出MedCLIP-SAMv2框架，通过整合CLIP与SAM模型实现基于文本提示的临床扫描分割，支持零样本和弱监督两种模式。我们的方法包括：采用新型解耦硬负样本噪声对比估计（DHN-NCE）损失微调BiomedCLIP模型，利用多模态信息瓶颈（M2IB）生成视觉提示以驱动SAM在零样本条件下产生分割掩膜，并探索在弱监督范式下使用零样本分割标签进一步提升分割质量。在四种不同分割任务（乳腺肿瘤超声、脑肿瘤MRI、肺部X光及肺部CT）和成像模态上的广泛验证表明，该框架具有高精度优势。代码已开源：https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/MedCLIP-SAMv2。 | 40779830 | Medical Image Analysis |

Unbiased single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CD11c+ cells identified both immature and differentiated lung cDC populations. GM-CSF deficiency disrupted antiapoptotic Bcl2a1 up-regulation and impaired progression to the CD301b+ transcriptional state. Despite the positioning of CD301b+ cDC2s in lymphoid cell-rich adventitial cuff areas, hematopoietic GM-CSF was dispensable for their development. Instead, alveolar epithelial type 2 cell-derived GM-CSF was required for CD301b+ cDC2 formation and pulmonary type 2 immune responses, highlighting the central role of GM-CSF signaling in shaping the pulmonary myeloid landscape. | 肺常规树突细胞（cDCs）是一类在功能和表型上具有异质性的抗原呈递细胞，对协调肺部适应性免疫应答至关重要。本研究揭示了粒细胞-巨噬细胞集落刺激因子（GM-CSF）信号在终末分化的CD301b+ cDC2亚群（与CD103+XCR1+ cDC1并列）发育过程中的细胞自主作用。通过对CD11c+细胞进行无偏单细胞转录组分析，我们同时鉴定了未成熟和已分化的肺cDC群体。GM-CSF缺失会破坏抗凋亡因子Bcl2a1的上调，并阻碍细胞向CD301b+转录状态的转化。尽管CD301b+ cDC2定位于富含淋巴细胞的血管外膜套区，但其发育并不依赖于造血源性的GM-CSF。相反，肺泡II型上皮细胞来源的GM-CSF是CD301b+ cDC2形成及肺部2型免疫应答所必需的，这凸显了GM-CSF信号在塑造肺髓系细胞格局中的核心作用。 | 40779647 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Senescent cell heterogeneity and responses to senolytic treatment are related to cell cycle status during senescence induction. | 衰老细胞的异质性及对衰老清除治疗的反应与衰老诱导过程中的细胞周期状态有关。 | Neri Francesco, Zheng Shuyuan, Watson Mark A, Desprez Pierre-Yves, Gerencser Akos A et al. | Aging (2025) | Cellular senescence has been strongly linked to aging and age-related diseases. It is well established that the phenotype of senescent cells is highly heterogeneous and influenced by their cell type and senescence-inducing stimulus. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies identified heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. However, proof of functional differences between such subpopulations is lacking. To identify functionally distinct senescent cell subpopulations, we employed high-content image analysis to measure senescence marker expression in primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. We found that G2-arrested senescent cells feature higher senescence marker expression than G1-arrested senescent cells. To investigate functional differences, we compared IL-6 secretion and response to ABT263 senolytic treatment in G1 and G2 senescent cells. We determined that G2-arrested senescent cells secrete more IL-6 and are more sensitive to ABT263 than G1-arrested cells. We hypothesize that cell cycle dependent DNA content is a key contributor to the heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. This study demonstrates the existence of functionally distinct senescent subpopulations even in culture. This data provides the first evidence of selective cell response to senolytic treatment among senescent cell subpopulations. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the senescent cell heterogeneity in the development of future senolytic therapies. | 细胞衰老与衰老及年龄相关疾病密切相关。研究表明，衰老细胞的表型具有高度异质性，并受其细胞类型和衰老诱导刺激的影响。近期单细胞RNA测序研究发现了衰老细胞群体内部的异质性，但尚缺乏这些亚群间功能差异的证据。为识别功能不同的衰老细胞亚群，我们采用高内涵图像分析技术检测原代人内皮细胞和成纤维细胞中衰老标志物的表达。研究发现，G2期阻滞的衰老细胞比G1期阻滞的衰老细胞表现出更高的衰老标志物表达水平。为探究功能差异，我们比较了G1和G2期衰老细胞的IL-6分泌能力及对ABT263衰老清除药物的反应。结果表明，G2期阻滞的衰老细胞不仅分泌更多IL-6，对ABT263的敏感性也高于G1期细胞。我们推测细胞周期依赖的DNA含量是导致衰老细胞群体异质性的关键因素。本研究首次证明即使在培养条件下，衰老细胞也存在功能差异的亚群，并提供了衰老细胞亚群对清除治疗存在选择性反应的直接证据。这项工作凸显了在未来衰老清除疗法开发中考虑细胞异质性的重要性。 | 40778874 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Five-Year Clinical and MRI-Based Outcomes After Cartilage Repair With or Without ACL Reconstruction: Worse Clinical Outcome after ACL Reconstruction Does not Affect Cartilage Repair Tissue Quality. | 五年临床及MRI随访结果：伴或不伴前交叉韧带重建的软骨修复效果比较——前交叉韧带重建后临床结果较差但未影响软骨修复组织质量。 | Koenig Felix R M, Vetchy Veronika, Wollner Gregor, Kern Maximilian, Raudner Marcus et al. | Cartilage (2025) | ObjectivesCartilage repair (CR) surgery and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) are common joint procedures, particularly in younger patients. However, the impact of prior or concurrent ACL-R on the outcomes of CR remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate whether ACL-R affects the structural quality and clinical outcomes of CR tissue.MethodsIn this retrospective multicenter study, 71 patients undergoing CR were followed up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluations at 3, 12, and 60 months. Of these, 22 patients underwent ACL-R before or during CR. Morphological assessment was performed using Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) 2.0 scores; compositional analysis included T2 mapping (n = 45). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) were assessed at all time points. Statistical tests included the Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and simulation-based power analysis.ResultsMOCART 2.0 scores and T2 mapping values showed no significant group differences at any time point. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in PROMs from baseline to 60 months. However, at 60 months, the ACL-R group had significantly lower PROMs than the non-ACL-R group.ConclusionAlthough long-term clinical outcomes were worse in patients with ACL-R, all PROMs improved significantly from baseline to 60 months in both groups. MRI showed no significant differences in focal CR tissue quality, suggesting structural success regardless of ACL-R. While ACL-R patients remain at higher risk of joint degeneration, they can still experience mid-term clinical benefit from CR. These findings support its use in ACL-R patients when joint function is properly restored and expectations are managed. | 目的：软骨修复（CR）手术与前交叉韧带重建（ACL-R）是常见的关节手术，尤其在年轻患者中更为普遍。然而，既往或同期进行的ACL-R对CR效果的影响尚不明确。本研究旨在评估ACL-R是否会影响CR组织的结构质量及临床疗效。  <br>方法：在这项回顾性多中心研究中，71例接受CR治疗的患者在术后3、12和60个月接受了磁共振成像（MRI）与临床评估。其中22例患者在CR术前或术中同期接受了ACL-R。采用MOCART 2.0评分系统进行形态学评估，成分分析包括T2 mapping（n=45）。所有时间点均收集患者报告结局指标（PROM）。统计方法包括Mann-Whitney U检验、Wilcoxon符号秩检验及基于模拟的效能分析。  <br>结果：MOCART 2.0评分与T2 mapping值在各时间点均无显著组间差异。两组患者PROM从基线至60个月均显著改善，但60个月时ACL-R组的PROM显著低于非ACL-R组。  <br>结论：尽管ACL-R患者的长期临床结局较差，但两组PROM从基线至60个月均显著改善。MRI显示局灶性CR组织结构质量无显著差异，表明无论是否接受ACL-R，CR在结构上均取得成功。虽然ACL-R患者关节退变风险更高，但仍能从中期CR治疗中获得临床获益。这些发现支持在关节功能妥善恢复且预期管理得当的情况下，对ACL-R患者实施CR手术。 | 40778441 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Artificial Intelligence-based Approaches for Characterizing Plaque Components From Intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging: Integration Into Clinical Decision Support Systems. | 基于人工智能的血管内光学相干断层扫描成像斑块成分表征方法：融入临床决策支持系统。 | Sperti Michela, Cardaci Camilla, Bruno Francesco, Shah Syed Taimoor Hussain, Panagiotopoulos Konstantinos et al. | Reviews in cardiovascular medicine (2025) | Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) is emerging as an effective imaging technique for accurately characterizing coronary atherosclerotic plaques. This technique provides detailed information on plaque morphology and composition, enabling the identification of high-risk features associated with coronary artery disease and adverse cardiovascular events. However, despite advancements in imaging technology and image assessment, the adoption of IVOCT in clinical practice remains limited. Manual plaque assessment by experts is time-consuming, prone to errors, and affected by high inter-observer variability. To increase productivity, precision, and reproducibility, researchers are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques into IVOCT analysis pipelines. Machine learning algorithms, trained on labelled datasets, have demonstrated robust classification of various plaque types. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, further improve performance by enabling automatic feature extraction. This reduces the reliance on predefined criteria, which often require domain-specific expertise, and allow for more flexible and comprehensive plaque characterization. AI-driven approaches aim to facilitate the integration of IVOCT into routine clinical practice, potentially transforming this technique from a research tool into a powerful aid for clinical decision-making. This narrative review aims to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of AI-based methods for analyzing IVOCT images of coronary arteries, with a focus on plaque characterization, and (ii) explore the clinical translation of AI to IVOCT, highlighting AI-powered tools for plaque characterization currently intended for commercial and/or clinical use. While these technologies represent significant progress, current solutions remain limited in the range of plaque features these methods can assess. Additionally, many of these solutions are confined to specific regulatory or research settings. Therefore, this review highlights the need for further advancements in AI-based IVOCT analysis, emphasizing the importance of additional validation and improved integration with clinical systems to enhance plaque characterization, support clinical decision-making, and advance risk prediction. | 血管内光学相干断层扫描（IVOCT）正逐渐成为一种有效成像技术，可精准表征冠状动脉粥样硬化斑块。该技术能提供斑块形态和成分的详细信息，有助于识别与冠状动脉疾病及不良心血管事件相关的高危特征。然而，尽管成像技术和图像评估不断进步，IVOCT在临床实践中的应用仍有限。专家手动评估斑块耗时费力、易出错，且存在观察者间差异大的问题。为提高效率、精度和可重复性，研究人员正越来越多地将人工智能（AI）技术整合到IVOCT分析流程中。基于标记数据集训练的机器学习算法已展现出对各类斑块的强大分类能力，而深度学习模型（尤其是卷积神经网络）通过自动特征提取进一步提升了性能。这降低了对需领域专业知识预定义标准的依赖，使斑块表征更灵活全面。AI驱动的方法旨在推动IVOCT融入常规临床实践，有望将该技术从研究工具转变为临床决策的有力辅助。本文旨在：（1）全面综述基于AI的冠状动脉IVOCT图像分析方法（聚焦斑块表征）；（2）探讨AI在IVOCT中的临床转化，重点介绍当前拟用于商业/临床的AI斑块表征工具。尽管这些技术取得重大进展，现有解决方案对斑块特征的评估范围仍有限，且多局限于特定监管或研究环境。因此，本文强调需进一步推进基于AI的IVOCT分析，加强额外验证及与临床系统的整合，以提升斑块表征能力、支持临床决策并推动风险预测发展。 | 40776963 | Medical Image Analysis |

With the growing need to implement online learning in medical institutions in Asia, training programs for information technology technicians and medical staff are needed to conduct such activities. However, the target activities, skills, and other training requirements remain unknown. This study identified the current training needs for conducting D-to-D telemedicine conferences/consultations in Asian medical institutions by surveying the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network Medical Working Group. Public workshops were held in August and December 2023, involving 26 IT engineers and physicians from 18 institutions in 9 countries and 27 participants IT engineers, physicians, and researchers from 24 institutions in 14 countries who presented and discussed activities, technical assistance, and training needs in D-to-D conferences/consultations. A thematic-based qualitative content analysis was conducted on verbatim transcripts of workshop conversations that were recorded and made available online. A total of 187 codes were extracted under four categories: "Conferences, consultations, webinars and meetings" (71 codes), "Live demonstrations" (37 codes) "Hybrid conference setup" (21 codes), and "Integrating virtual reality technology" (58 codes). The evolution of information and communication technology has necessitated the expansion of training meant for IT staff to medical staff. However, hurdles in addressing technical issues persist, and training is required to troubleshoot a wide range of video, audio, and videoconferencing systems and networks. The additional needs identified included skills in building video and audio configurations to suit a conference room in hybrid venue setups, stable, high-quality image delivery for live demonstrations, and skills to use virtual reality technologies such as 360-degree video delivery and metaverse platforms. | 亚洲医疗资源差距显著，而医生间远程医疗会议/会诊能有效缩小医务人员知识与技能鸿沟。随着亚洲医疗机构对在线学习需求增长，需开展针对信息技术人员与医务人员的培训以实施此类活动。然而具体培训目标、技能要求等仍不明确。本研究通过调查亚太高级网络医疗工作组，明确了亚洲医疗机构开展医生间远程医疗会议/会诊的培训需求。2023年8月和12月举办公开研讨会，汇集来自9国18家机构的26名IT工程师与医师，以及14国24家机构的27名IT工程师、医师及研究人员，共同探讨远程会议/会诊中的活动、技术支持及培训需求。对研讨会录音逐字转录文本进行主题定性内容分析，共提取187条代码，归为四类："会议、会诊、网络研讨会"（71条）、"实时演示"（37条）、"混合会议设置"（21条）、"虚拟现实技术整合"（58条）。信息通信技术发展要求将原本面向IT人员的培训扩展至医务人员，但技术故障排除仍存在障碍，需培训解决各类视频、音频及会议系统与网络问题的能力。新发现的培训需求包括：混合会场中会议室音视频配置搭建技能、实时演示的稳定高清图像传输技术，以及360度视频传输与元宇宙平台等虚拟现实技术的应用能力。 | 40776094 | Medical Image Analysis |

| A New Approach to Perfusion-Weighted Image Analysis: Measurement via Red-Green-Blue Information Inversion. | 灌注加权图像分析新方法：基于红绿蓝信息反转的测量。 | Kim Taeyeon, Kim Youngsoo, Lee Youjin, Kim Injung, Song Seungeon et al. | Studies in health technology and informatics (2025) | This study developed and validated a Python-based program for analyzing the region of interest mean values using red-green-blue (RGB)-reconstructed perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) data. The program addressed the limitations of traditional source-image-based analysis, including manufacturer dependency, high storage costs, and limited accessibility. High intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for cerebral blood volume and time to peak confirmed the feasibility of this approach, whereas lower ICC values for mean transit time suggested discrepancies between reconstructed RGB images and conventional dynamic susceptibility contrast-based data. Designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface and executable distribution, the program enhances clinical applicability. Future studies should focus on improving the algorithms and validating the approach with multicenter datasets. | 本研究开发并验证了一款基于Python的程序，用于通过红绿蓝（RGB）重建的灌注加权成像（PWI）数据分析感兴趣区域的平均值。该程序解决了传统基于源图像分析的局限性，包括厂商依赖性、高存储成本和可访问性受限等问题。脑血容量和达峰时间的高组内相关系数（ICC）值证实了该方法的可行性，而平均通过时间的较低ICC值则表明重建RGB图像与传统动态磁敏感对比数据之间存在差异。该程序设计了用户友好的图形界面和可执行分发版本，增强了临床适用性。未来研究应着重优化算法，并通过多中心数据集验证该方法。 | 40775987 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Quantitative image analysis of the extracellular matrix of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and high grade dysplasia via two-photon microscopy. | 通过双光子显微镜对食管鳞状细胞癌及高级别不典型增生细胞外基质进行定量图像分析。 | Makkithaya Kausalya Neelavara, Chen Wei-Chung, Wu Chun-Chieh, Chen Ming-Chi, Wang Wei-Hsun et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) are two different pathological entities; however, they sometimes share similarities in histological structure depending on the context. Thus, distinguishing between the two may require careful examination by a pathologist and consideration of clinical findings. Unlike previous studies on cancer diagnosis using two-photon microscopy, quantitative analysis or machine learning (ML) algorithms need to be used to determine the subtle structural changes in images and the structural features that are statistically meaningful in cancer development. In this study, we aimed to quantitatively distinguish between SCC and HGD using two-photon microscopy combined with ML. Tissue samples were categorized into two groups: Group 1, primary SCC vs. metachronous HGD (SCC-HGD) and Group 2, primary HGD vs. metachronous HGD (HGD-HGD). We quantitatively analyzed second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon fluorescence (TPF) signals from two-photon microscopy imaging of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract the textural features of the tissue images, and support vector machine (SVM), for classification of the tissue images based on their pathologies. The SHG-based classifiers demonstrated 75%, 84.21%, 95%, and 95.65% for Group 1, Group 2, primary SCC vs. primary HGD, and metachronous HGD (Group 1) vs. metachronous HGD (Group 2), respectively. This integrative approach enabled the characterization of different pathological stages and enhances the understanding of the pathogenic factors involved in the progression of esophageal cancer. | 鳞状细胞癌（SCC）与高级别不典型增生（HGD）是两种不同的病理学实体，但在某些情况下，它们的组织学结构可能存在相似之处。因此，区分二者需要病理学家进行仔细检查并结合临床发现。与以往利用双光子显微镜进行癌症诊断的研究不同，本研究需采用定量分析或机器学习（ML）算法来识别图像中的细微结构变化及在癌症发展中具有统计学意义的结构特征。本研究旨在通过双光子显微镜结合ML技术实现SCC与HGD的定量区分。组织样本分为两组：第一组为原发性SCC与异时性HGD（SCC-HGD），第二组为原发性HGD与异时性HGD（HGD-HGD）。我们定量分析了细胞外基质（ECM）双光子显微成像产生的二次谐波（SHG）和双光子荧光（TPF）信号，采用灰度共生矩阵（GLCM）提取组织图像的纹理特征，并运用支持向量机（SVM）根据病理类型对组织图像进行分类。基于SHG的分类器在第一组、第二组、原发性SCC与原发性HGD、以及异时性HGD（第一组）与异时性HGD（第二组）中的分类准确率分别为75%、84.21%、95%和95.65%。这种整合方法实现了不同病理阶段的特征化描述，并深化了对食管癌进展相关致病因素的理解。 | 40775026 | Medical Image Analysis |
| An open-source platform for structured annotation and computational workflows in digital pathology research. | 数字病理学研究中用于结构化标注和计算工作流程的开源平台。 | Lianas Luca, Del Rio Mauro, Pireddu Luca, Aspegren Oskar, Giunchi Francesca et al. | Scientific reports (2025) | The rapid evolution of digital pathology has enabled large-scale data acquisition, driving sophisticated clinical research and advancing the development of AI-driven tools. These innovations have also revolutionised histopathological slide review, especially the annotation step (i.e. the process of marking specific areas of interest on glass-mounted tissue samples to add relevant clinical information) by digitising the process, enhancing precision and efficiency, and facilitating collaboration. However, currently available open-source annotation tools typically employ single-label approaches that provide a flat representation of whole-slide images (WSI), limiting their ability to capture the complexity of the diagnosis-significant elements in a detailed and structured way. Furthermore, the difficulty of strictly following precise review protocols and lack of provenance tracking during annotation processes can result in high variability and limit reproducibility and reusability of the collected data. In this work we present the CRS4 Digital Pathology Platform (CDPP), an open-source system for research studies that manages WSI collections and focuses on high-quality, structured annotations, gathered according to well-defined protocols. Its main features include: (1) structured, multi-label morphological and clinical image annotation; (2) support for controlled but customisable annotation protocols; (3) dedicated annotation tools to facilitate enhanced accuracy, efficiency and consistency in the annotation process; and (4) workflow-based computational analysis with integrated provenance tracking. We show how the platform has successfully supported three different studies, demonstrating the CDPP's ability to assist pathologists in the generation of high-quality annotated datasets, also suitable for reuse, in the context of digital pathology research. | 数字病理学的快速发展实现了大规模数据采集，推动了复杂临床研究的开展，并促进了人工智能驱动工具的进步。这些创新通过流程数字化、提升精确度与效率以及促进协作，彻底改变了组织病理学切片审查方式，尤其是标注环节（即在玻片组织样本上标记特定关注区域以添加相关临床信息的过程）。然而当前开源标注工具通常采用单标签方法，仅提供整张切片图像（WSI）的平面化呈现，难以以细致结构化的方式捕捉诊断关键要素的复杂性。此外，由于难以严格遵循精确审查协议且缺乏标注过程的溯源追踪，导致数据采集存在高度变异性，限制了数据的可重复性和复用性。本文介绍CRS4数字病理学平台（CDPP），这是一个用于管理WSI集合的开源研究系统，专注于依据明确定义协议采集高质量结构化标注。其主要功能包括：（1）结构化多标签形态学与临床图像标注；（2）支持受控但可定制的标注协议；（3）专用标注工具以提升标注过程的准确性、效率与一致性；（4）基于工作流的计算分析及集成溯源追踪。我们展示了该平台如何成功支持三项不同研究，证明CDPP在数字病理学研究中能协助病理学家生成高质量可复用标注数据集的能力。 | 40775009 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Photon-counting detector computed tomography meets orthopantomography: a cinematic rendering solution for superior structural visualization. | 光子计数探测器计算机断层扫描与口腔全景摄影相遇：一种实现卓越结构可视化的电影级渲染解决方案。 | Stadlinger B, Engel K, Al-Haj Husain A, Alkadhi H | International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery (2025) | This technical note introduces an innovative technique for overlaying photorealistic three-dimensional (3D) visualization cinematic renderings of ultra-high-resolution photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) scans onto conventional orthopantomography (OPG) images, enhancing visualization and aiding in the detection of subsurface structures and incidental findings. OPG is commonly used to assess dentomaxillofacial conditions, generating a summation image on a two-dimensional (2D) plane through a circular tomographic path. While useful for the initial evaluation, OPG has limitations, such as overlapping structures and restricted soft tissue visualization. More detailed analysis often requires 3D imaging modalities like cone beam computed tomography or conventional computed tomography. Recently introduced PCD-CT provides high-resolution images with lower noise, enhanced soft tissue contrast, and reduced artefacts. A novel technique of overlaying a photorealistic 3D cinematic rendering of a PCD-CT scan onto a conventional 2D OPG image of the same patient is introduced that enhances OPG by revealing subsurface structures such as blood vessels and improves understanding of the 3D anatomy. By associating the 3D anatomy with this 2D image, the technique enhances the clinician's understanding of three-dimensionality and may potentially aid in the detection of incidental findings in OPGs, such as calcifications in the angle of the jaw. | 本技术说明介绍了一种创新技术，可将超高分辨率光子计数探测器计算机断层扫描（PCD-CT）生成的逼真三维可视化电影级渲染图像叠加到传统曲面断层摄影（OPG）图像上，从而增强可视化效果并辅助检测皮下结构及偶发征象。OPG通常用于评估牙颌面状况，通过环形断层扫描路径在二维平面上生成叠加图像。虽然OPG适用于初步评估，但其存在结构重叠、软组织显像受限等缺陷。更精细的分析往往需要锥形束CT或传统CT等三维成像技术。最新推出的PCD-CT能提供噪声更低、软组织对比度更高、伪影更少的高分辨率图像。本文提出的新技术将PCD-CT扫描的逼真3D电影级渲染图像叠加到同一患者的传统2D OPG图像上，通过显示血管等皮下结构增强OPG成像效果，并提升对三维解剖结构的理解。该技术通过建立三维解剖结构与二维图像的关联，可强化临床医师对立体解剖的认知，并可能辅助发现OPG中的偶发征象（如下颌角钙化灶）。 | 40774873 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Contrastive learning and prior knowledge-induced feature extraction network for prediction of high-risk recurrence areas in Gliomas. | 对比学习与先验知识引导的特征提取网络在胶质瘤高风险复发区域预测中的应用。 | Wu Boya, Cao Jianyun, Xiong Wei, Lv Yanchun, Zhao Guohua et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | Gliomas can easily recur even after standard treatments, and their recurrence may be related to insufficient radiation doses received by high-risk recurrence areas (HRA). Therefore, HRA prediction can help clinical experts in formulating effective radiotherapy plans. However, research on HRA prediction using early postoperative conventional MRI images with total resection is lacking. This gap is due to multifold challenges, including visually minimal differences between HRA and non-HRA and small dataset size caused by missing follow-up data. A contrastive learning and prior knowledge-induced feature extraction network (CLPKnet) to explore HRA-related features and achieve HRA prediction was proposed in this paper. First, a contrastive and multisequence learning-based encoder was proposed to effectively extract diverse features across multiple MRI sequences around the operative cavity. Specifically, a contrastive learning method was employed to pretrain the encoder, which enabled it to capture subtle differences between HRA and non-HRA regions while mitigating the challenges posed by the limited dataset size. Second, clinical prior knowledge was incorporated into the CLPKnet to guide the model in learning the patterns of glioma growth and improve its discriminative capability for identifying HRA regions. Third, a dual-focus fusion module was utilized to explore important sequential features and spatial regions and effectively fused multisequence features to provide complementary information associated with glioma recurrence. Fourth, to balance clinical needs and task difficulty, we used a patch-based prediction method to predict the recurrent probability. The CLPKnet was validated on a multicenter dataset from four hospitals, and a remarkable performance was achieved. Moreover, the interpretability and robustness of our method were evaluated to illustrate its effectiveness and credibility. Therefore, the CLPKnet displays a great application potential for HRA prediction. The codes will be available at https://github.com/Meiyan88/CLPKnet. | 胶质瘤即使在标准治疗后也极易复发，其复发可能与高风险复发区域（HRA）接受的辐射剂量不足有关。因此，HRA预测有助于临床专家制定有效的放疗计划。然而，利用早期术后常规MRI图像进行全切除后的HRA预测研究尚属空白。这一空白源于多重挑战，包括HRA与非HRA区域视觉差异微小，以及随访数据缺失导致的小样本问题。本文提出了一种对比学习与先验知识引导的特征提取网络（CLPKnet），用于挖掘HRA相关特征并实现HRA预测。首先，我们设计了一个基于对比学习和多序列学习的编码器，以有效提取手术腔周围多序列MRI的多样化特征。具体而言，采用对比学习方法对编码器进行预训练，使其能够捕捉HRA与非HRA区域的细微差异，同时缓解小样本带来的挑战。其次，将临床先验知识融入CLPKnet，引导模型学习胶质瘤生长模式，提升其识别HRA区域的判别能力。第三，采用双焦点融合模块挖掘重要序列特征和空间区域，有效融合多序列特征以提供与肿瘤复发相关的互补信息。第四，为平衡临床需求与任务难度，采用基于图像块的预测方法计算复发概率。CLPKnet在来自四家医院的多中心数据集上验证并展现出卓越性能。此外，通过评估方法的可解释性和鲁棒性，验证了其有效性与可靠性。因此，CLPKnet在HRA预测领域具有重要应用潜力。代码将在https://github.com/Meiyan88/CLPKnet公开。 | 40774099 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Brain Latent Progression: Individual-based spatiotemporal disease progression on 3D Brain MRIs via latent diffusion. | 脑潜在进展：通过潜在扩散在3D脑部MRI上实现基于个体的时空疾病进展。 | Puglisi Lemuel, Alexander Daniel C, Ravì Daniele | Medical image analysis (2025) | The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction at the global and voxel level. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/LemuelPuglisi/BrLP. | 纵向磁共振成像（MRI）数据集的日益丰富推动了人工智能（AI）驱动的疾病进展建模，使得预测个体患者未来的医学扫描成为可能。然而，尽管AI取得了显著进展，现有方法仍面临诸多挑战，包括实现患者特异性个体化、确保时空一致性、高效利用纵向数据以及应对3D扫描的巨大内存需求。为解决这些问题，我们提出了Brain Latent Progression（BrLP）——一种新型时空模型，专为预测3D脑MRI中的个体级疾病进展而设计。BrLP的核心贡献有四点：（i）在小型潜在空间中运行，缓解高维影像数据带来的计算挑战；（ii）显式整合受试者元数据以增强预测的个体化；（iii）通过辅助模型融入疾病动态先验知识，促进纵向数据整合；（iv）引入Latent Average Stabilization（LAS）算法，该算法（a）在推理时强制预测进展的时空一致性，（b）允许我们在全局和体素层面获得预测的不确定性度量。我们在2,805名受试者的11,730次T1加权（T1w）脑MRI上训练并评估BrLP，并在包含962名受试者2,257次MRI的外部测试集上验证其泛化能力。实验将BrLP生成的MRI扫描与真实随访MRI对比，结果显示其准确性优于现有方法。代码已开源：https://github.com/LemuelPuglisi/BrLP。 | 40774097 | Medical Image Analysis |
| EATHOA: Elite-evolved hiking algorithm for global optimization and precise multi-thresholding image segmentation in intracerebral hemorrhage images. | EATHOA：精英进化远足算法，用于脑出血图像的全局优化和精确多阈值分割。 | Abdel-Salam Mahmoud, Houssein Essam H, Emam Marwa M, Samee Nagwan Abdel, Gharehchopogh Farhad Soleimanian et al. | Computers in biology and medicine (2025) | Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening condition caused by bleeding in the brain, with high mortality rates, particularly in the acute phase. Accurate diagnosis through medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in early intervention and treatment. However, existing segmentation methods, such as region-growing, clustering, and deep learning, face significant limitations when applied to complex images like ICH, especially in multi-threshold image segmentation (MTIS). As the number of thresholds increases, these methods often become computationally expensive and exhibit degraded segmentation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Elite-Adaptive-Turbulent Hiking Optimization Algorithm (EATHOA), an enhanced version of the Hiking Optimization Algorithm (HOA), specifically designed for high-dimensional and multimodal optimization problems like ICH image segmentation. EATHOA integrates three novel strategies including Elite Opposition-Based Learning (EOBL) for improving population diversity and exploration, Adaptive k-Average-Best Mutation (AKAB) for dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation, and a Turbulent Operator (TO) for escaping local optima and enhancing the convergence rate. Extensive experiments were conducted on the CEC2017 and CEC2022 benchmark functions to evaluate EATHOA's global optimization performance, where it consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed EATHOA was then applied to solve the MTIS problem in ICH images at six different threshold levels. EATHOA achieved peak values of PSNR (34.4671), FSIM (0.9710), and SSIM (0.8816), outperforming recent methods in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the superior performance of EATHOA and its potential as a powerful tool for medical image analysis, offering an effective and computationally efficient solution for the complex challenges of ICH image segmentation. | 脑出血（ICH）是一种由脑内出血引发的危及生命的疾病，具有高死亡率，尤其在急性期。通过医学影像分割实现精准诊断对早期干预和治疗至关重要。然而，现有分割方法（如区域生长法、聚类法和深度学习）在处理脑出血等复杂图像时存在显著局限，特别是在多阈值图像分割（MTIS）中。随着阈值数量增加，这些方法往往计算成本高昂且分割性能下降。为解决这些问题，本文提出精英自适应湍流徒步优化算法（EATHOA）——徒步优化算法（HOA）的增强版本，专为脑出血图像分割等高维多模态优化问题设计。EATHOA融合三项创新策略：精英反向学习（EOBL）提升种群多样性和探索能力，自适应k均值最优变异（AKAB）动态平衡探索与开发，湍流算子（TO）用于逃离局部最优并加速收敛。在CEC2017和CEC2022基准函数上的大量实验表明，EATHOA在全局优化性能上持续超越其他先进算法。将该算法应用于六种不同阈值水平的脑出血图像MTIS问题时，EATHOA取得峰值PSNR（34.4671）、FSIM（0.9710）和SSIM（0.8816），在分割精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。这些结果验证了EATHOA的卓越性能及其作为医学影像分析工具的潜力，为脑出血图像分割的复杂挑战提供了高效计算解决方案。 | 40773994 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Categorized and individualized behavioral phenotyping approaches for control and triple-hit schizophrenia-like model rats in acute and chronic reward-based systems: A pilot study. | 急性和慢性基于奖励的系统中对照和三重打击精神分裂症样模型大鼠的分类和个体化行为表型分析方法：一项初步研究。 | Hernadi Zsofia, Kormoczi Laszlo, Adlan Leatitia G, Kekesi Gabriella, Büki Alexandra et al. | PloS one (2025) | A wide variety of acute test procedures are used for the behavioral characterization of schizophrenia rodent models, but prolonged observation in home-cage systems remains underexplored. This study aimed to profile the behavior of control (Wistar) and triple-hit schizophrenia-like (Wisket) model rats under two reward-based test conditions: the acute Ambitus test, a simple reward-collection task, and the delay-discounting paradigm in the HomeManner system, designed for extended observation periods. Wisket rats exhibited significant behavioral impairments compared to Wistar rats in the Ambitus test. However, in the HomeManner system, no significant group differences were observed at the cohort level due to heterogeneous individual behavioral patterns. Specifically, only half of the rats explored both food-providing trays, while others focused on one or ignored both. Subgroup analysis, based on tray activity patterns, revealed that Wisket rats displayed impaired cognitive processes and greater intolerance to delayed food rewards. Furthermore, personalized analysis indicated lower behavioral variability within the Wisket group compared to controls. The absence of a strong correlation between performance in the Ambitus and HomeManner tests suggests that these assessments capture distinct behavioral characteristics. This pilot study provides an extended behavioral phenotyping of rat substrains under both acute and chronic conditions. The automated HomeManner system demonstrates potential as a valuable tool for prolonged behavioral assessments. Importantly, this study underscores the value of categorized and personalized analyses in revealing behavioral differences that may not be apparent in group-level comparisons, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of preclinical research. | 多种急性测试程序被用于精神分裂症啮齿动物模型的行为表征，但家庭笼系统中的长期观察仍未被充分探索。本研究旨在对比对照组（Wistar大鼠）和三重打击精神分裂症样（Wisket）模型大鼠在两种奖励测试条件下的行为表现：急性Ambitus测试（简单的奖励收集任务）和HomeManner系统中的延迟折扣范式（专为长期观察设计）。Wisket大鼠在Ambitus测试中表现出较Wistar大鼠显著的行为缺陷。然而在HomeManner系统中，由于个体行为模式的异质性，队列层面未观察到显著组间差异。具体而言，仅半数大鼠会探索两个食物供给托盘，其余则专注于单个托盘或完全忽视。基于托盘活动模式的亚组分析显示，Wisket大鼠存在认知过程受损和对延迟食物奖励更低的耐受性。个性化分析进一步表明Wisket组的行为变异性低于对照组。Ambitus与HomeManner测试表现间缺乏强相关性，提示这两种评估捕捉了不同的行为特征。这项初步研究提供了急慢性条件下大鼠亚种系的扩展行为表型分析。自动化HomeManner系统展现出作为长期行为评估工具的潜力。值得注意的是，本研究强调了分类分析和个性化分析在揭示群体水平比较中不显著的行为差异方面的价值，从而提升了临床前研究的转化相关性。 | 40773442 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Uncertainty-aware Medical Diagnostic Phrase Identification and Grounding. | 不确定性感知的医学诊断短语识别与定位。 | Zou Ke, Bai Yang, Liu Bo, Chen Yidi, Chen Zhihao et al. | IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence (2025) | Medical phrase grounding is crucial for identifying relevant regions in medical images based on phrase queries, facilitating accurate image analysis and diagnosis. However, current methods rely on manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, reducing efficiency and increasing the workload for clinicians. Additionally, the lack of model confidence estimation limits clinical trust and usability. In this paper, we introduce a novel task-Medical Report Grounding (MRG)-which aims to directly identify diagnostic phrases and their corresponding grounding boxes from medical reports in an end-to-end manner. To address this challenge, we propose uMedGround, a robust and reliable framework that leverages a multimodal large language model to predict diagnostic phrases by embedding a unique token, $\lt $$\mathtt {BOX}$$\gt $, into the vocabulary to enhance detection capabilities. A vision encoder-decoder processes the embedded token and input image to generate grounding boxes. Critically, uMedGround incorporates an uncertainty-aware prediction model, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of grounding predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that uMedGround outperforms state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods and fine-tuned large visual-language models, validating its effectiveness and reliability. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the MRG task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of uMedGround in medical visual question answering and class-based localization tasks, where it highlights visual evidence aligned with key diagnostic phrases, supporting clinicians in interpreting various types of textual inputs, including free-text reports, visual question answering queries, and class labels. | 医学短语定位技术对于基于短语查询识别医学图像中的相关区域至关重要，有助于实现精准的图像分析与诊断。然而，现有方法依赖从医疗报告中人工提取关键短语，不仅降低了效率，还增加了临床医生的工作负担。此外，模型缺乏置信度评估限制了临床信任度和实用性。本文提出一项创新任务——医学报告定位（MRG），旨在以端到端方式直接从医疗报告中识别诊断短语及其对应定位框。针对这一挑战，我们开发了uMedGround框架，该框架利用多模态大语言模型预测诊断短语，通过嵌入特殊标记$\lt $$\mathtt {BOX}$$\gt $至词汇表来增强检测能力。视觉编码器-解码器处理嵌入标记与输入图像以生成定位框。值得注意的是，uMedGround整合了不确定性感知预测模型，显著提升了定位预测的鲁棒性和可靠性。实验结果表明，uMedGround在性能上超越了当前最先进的医学短语定位方法和微调后的大型视觉语言模型，验证了其有效性与可靠性。本研究开创性地探索了MRG任务，成为该领域的首次尝试。此外，我们还展示了uMedGround在医学视觉问答和基于类别的定位任务中的应用价值，它能突显与关键诊断短语匹配的视觉证据，辅助临床医生解读各类文本输入，包括自由文本报告、视觉问答查询和类别标签。 | 40773383 | Medical Image Analysis |

In this proof-of-principle study, a deep learning approach to multi-material decomposition was developed to quantify iodine, gadolinium, and calcium in spectral CT. A dual-phase network architecture was trained using synthetic datasets containing computational models of cylindrical and virtual patient phantoms. Classification and quantification performance was evaluated across a range of patient size and dose parameters. The model was found to accurately classify (accuracy: cylinders - 98%, virtual patients - 97%) and quantify materials (mean absolute percentage difference: cylinders - 8-10%, virtual patients - 10-15%) in both datasets. Performance in virtual patient phantoms improved as the hybrid training dataset included a larger contingent of virtual patient phantoms (accuracy: 48% with 0 virtual patients to 97% with 8 virtual patients). For both datasets, the algorithm was able to maintain strong performance under challenging conditions of large patient size and reduced dose. This study shows the validity of a deep-learning based approach to multi-material decomposition trained with in-silico images that can overcome the limitations of conventional material decomposition approaches. | 传统能谱CT材料分解方法面临两大挑战：一是成像条件下精确算法校准的难题，二是物体尺寸变化和剂量降低导致的信号质量下降。在这项原理验证研究中，我们开发了一种基于深度学习的多材料分解方法，用于能谱CT中碘、钆和钙的定量分析。通过包含圆柱体计算模型和虚拟患者体模的合成数据集，我们训练了双阶段网络架构，并在不同患者体型和剂量参数下评估了分类与定量性能。该模型在两个数据集中均表现出优异的材料分类（准确率：圆柱体98%/虚拟患者97%）和定量能力（平均绝对百分比差异：圆柱体8-10%/虚拟患者10-15%）。随着混合训练数据集中虚拟患者体模比例增加（从0例提升至8例），虚拟患者体模的分类准确率从48%显著提高到97%。在超大体型患者和低剂量等挑战性条件下，该算法在两个数据集中均保持稳定性能。本研究表明，基于深度学习、采用计算机合成图像训练的多材料分解方法具有可行性，能够克服传统材料分解技术的局限性。 | 40770244 | Medical Image Analysis |

Until now, a robust, well-validated surrogate biomarker for cardiovascular events that reflects atherosclerosis itself has been lacking. This is particularly important as new therapeutic candidates targeting inflammation and factors downstream of low-density lipoprotein and other well-recognized factors continue to emerge. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as an ideal modality to image, characterize, and quantify specific plaque components, with potential for a more formal role in the CAD drug development pipeline. This review examines both morphological (high-risk plaque) and quantitative (specific plaque components) measures, considering their pathophysiological correlation with other imaging measures of atherosclerosis, evidence for the association of each component with major adverse cardiovascular events, and their responsiveness to effective drug treatments. Given the rapid advancement in coronary CTA acquisition and analysis technology, there is an urgent need for coordination and collaboration among key stakeholders, including imaging hardware and software companies, pharmaceutical companies, as well as clinicians, patients, regulators, and payers. Progress in this area, and the opportunities that may follow for the broader cardiovascular community if standardized coronary CTA endpoints are validated as surrogates for clinical drug trials, could accelerate innovation and enhance efficiency in CAD drug development. | 目前亟需新的途径来评估冠状动脉疾病（CAD）的治疗靶点和药物。虽然以主要不良心血管事件作为主要结局有利于提高研究严谨性，但大样本量需求、长研究周期及相关成本与风险仍是阻碍关键利益相关方参与的主要因素。迄今为止，仍缺乏一种能反映动脉粥样硬化本身、且经过充分验证的心血管事件替代生物标志物。这一点尤为重要，因为针对炎症、低密度脂蛋白下游因子及其他公认风险因素的新型候选疗法正不断涌现。冠状动脉CT血管造影（CTA）已成为成像、表征和量化特定斑块成分的理想手段，有望在CAD药物研发流程中发挥更正式的作用。本综述从病理生理学角度探讨了形态学（高风险斑块）与定量（特定斑块成分）指标与其他动脉粥样硬化影像学测量的关联性，分析了各成分与主要不良心血管事件的证据链，并评估其对有效药物治疗的响应性。鉴于冠状动脉CTA采集与分析技术的快速发展，亟需协调影像硬件/软件企业、制药公司、临床医生、患者、监管机构和支付方等关键利益相关方的合作。若标准化冠状动脉CTA终点能验证为临床药物试验的替代指标，相关领域的进展将为更广泛的心血管学界带来机遇，从而加速CAD药物研发的创新进程并提升效率。 | 40769623 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Attend-and-Refine: Interactive keypoint estimation and quantitative cervical vertebrae analysis for bone age assessment. | 参与与优化：用于骨龄评估的交互式关键点估计及颈椎定量分析。 | Kim Jinhee, Kim Taesung, Kim Taewoo, Kim Dong-Wook, Ahn Byungduk et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network, which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback, coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics, marking a significant advancement in the field. | 在儿童正畸治疗中，准确评估生长潜力对制定有效治疗策略至关重要。本研究旨在仅通过侧位头影测量片识别生长高峰并分析颈椎形态，从而预测这一潜力。我们通过全面分析这些影像中的颈椎成熟度（CVM）特征实现这一目标，为临床医生提供可靠高效的工具以确定最佳干预时机，最终改善患者疗效。该方法的关键在于对颈椎关键点的精细标注，这一过程常因耗时费力而受限。为此，我们提出基于深度学习的用户交互式模型——注意力优化网络（ARNet），通过交互引导的重校准网络动态响应用户反馈调整图像特征，并结合保持关键点结构一致性的形态感知损失函数，显著减少了人工标注工作量，提升了标注效率和精度。经多数据集验证，ARNet展现出卓越性能及在医学影像中的广泛适用性。本研究为儿童正畸生长潜力评估提供了高效的人工智能辅助诊断工具，标志着该领域的重要进展。 | 40769097 | Medical Image Analysis |
| Self-consistent recursive diffusion bridge for medical image translation. | 医学图像转换的自洽递归扩散桥。 | Arslan Fuat, Kabas Bilal, Dalmaz Onat, Ozbey Muzaffer, Çukur Tolga | Medical image analysis (2025) | Denoising diffusion models (DDM) have gained recent traction in medical image translation given their high training stability and image fidelity. DDMs learn a multi-step denoising transformation that progressively maps random Gaussian-noise images provided as input onto target-modality images as output, while receiving indirect guidance from source-modality images via a separate static channel. This denoising transformation diverges significantly from the task-relevant source-to-target modality transformation, as source images are governed by a non-noise distribution. In turn, DDMs can suffer from suboptimal source-modality guidance and performance losses in medical image translation. Here, we propose a novel self-consistent recursive diffusion bridge (SelfRDB) that leverages direct source-modality guidance within its diffusion process for improved performance in medical image translation. Unlike DDMs, SelfRDB devises a novel forward process with the start-point taken as the target image, and the end-point defined based on the source image. Intermediate image samples across the process are expressed via a normal distribution whose mean is taken as a convex combination of start-end points, and whose variance is controlled by additive noise. Unlike regular diffusion bridges that prescribe zero noise variance at start-end points and high noise variance at mid-point of the process, we propose a novel noise scheduling with monotonically increasing variance towards the end-point in order to facilitate information transfer between the two modalities and boost robustness against measurement noise. To further enhance sampling accuracy in each reverse step, we propose a novel sampling procedure where the network recursively generates a transient-estimate of the target image until convergence onto a self-consistent solution. Comprehensive experiments in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation indicate that SelfRDB achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality. | 去噪扩散模型（DDM）凭借其高训练稳定性和图像保真度，近期在医学图像转换领域受到关注。DDM通过学习多步去噪变换，逐步将输入的高斯噪声图像映射为目标模态输出图像，同时通过独立静态通道间接接收源模态图像的引导。由于源图像服从非噪声分布，这种去噪变换与任务相关的源-目标模态转换存在显著差异，导致DDM在医学图像转换中可能面临次优的源模态引导和性能损失。为此，我们提出了一种新型自洽递归扩散桥（SelfRDB），通过在扩散过程中直接利用源模态引导来提升医学图像转换性能。与DDM不同，SelfRDB设计了一种以前向过程为目标图像为起点、源图像为终点的创新框架。过程中间图像样本通过正态分布表示，其均值设为起点-终点的凸组合，方差由加性噪声控制。不同于常规扩散桥在起止点设零噪声方差、中点设高方差的方案，我们提出新型噪声调度策略——方差朝终点方向单调递增，以促进双模态间信息传递并增强对测量噪声的鲁棒性。为进一步提升逆向采样精度，我们设计了递归生成目标图像瞬态估计的新型采样流程，直至收敛至自洽解。多对比度MRI和MRI-CT转换的综合实验表明，SelfRDB在图像质量方面达到了最先进水平。 | 40769096 | Medical Image Analysis |
| SemiSAM+: Rethinking semi-supervised medical image segmentation in the era of foundation models. | SemiSAM+：基础模型时代下对半监督医学图像分割的再思考。 | Zhang Yichi, Lv Bohao, Xue Le, Zhang Wenbo, Liu Yuchen et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | Deep learning-based medical image segmentation typically requires large amount of labeled data for training, making it less applicable in clinical settings due to high annotation cost. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an appealing strategy due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods. Beyond existing model-centric advancements of SSL by designing novel regularization strategies, we anticipate a paradigmatic shift due to the emergence of promptable segmentation foundation models with universal segmentation capabilities using positional prompts represented by Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we present SemiSAM+, a foundation model-driven SSL framework to efficiently learn from limited labeled data for medical image segmentation. SemiSAM+ consists of one or multiple promptable foundation models as generalist models, and a trainable task-specific segmentation model as specialist model. For a given new segmentation task, the training is based on the specialist-generalist collaborative learning procedure, where the trainable specialist model delivers positional prompts to interact with the frozen generalist models to acquire pseudo-labels, and then the generalist model output provides the specialist model with informative and efficient supervision which benefits the automatic segmentation and prompt generation in turn. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and one in-house clinical dataset demonstrate that SemiSAM+ achieves significant performance improvement, especially under extremely limited annotation scenarios, and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily adapted to different specialist and generalist models. | 基于深度学习的医学图像分割通常需要大量标注数据进行训练，这使得其在临床应用中因高昂标注成本而受限。半监督学习（SSL）因其对专家标注数据的依赖性低于全监督方法，成为一种极具吸引力的策略。除了现有通过设计新型正则化策略推动SSL模型中心化发展的方法外，我们预见由于可提示分割基础模型（如采用位置提示的Segment Anything Model/SAM）的出现，该领域将迎来范式转变。本文提出SemiSAM+——一种基于基础模型的SSL框架，能够高效利用有限标注数据完成医学图像分割。该框架包含一个或多个可提示基础模型作为通用模型，以及一个可训练的任务专用分割模型作为专家模型。针对新分割任务，训练过程采用专家-通用协同学习机制：可训练的专家模型生成位置提示与冻结的通用模型交互以获取伪标签，通用模型的输出则为专家模型提供信息丰富且高效的监督信号，从而反过来提升自动分割和提示生成能力。在三个公共数据集和一个内部临床数据集上的大量实验表明，SemiSAM+实现了显著的性能提升（尤其在极低标注量场景下），并展现出作为即插即用策略的强大适应性——可轻松适配不同的专家模型与通用模型组合。 | 40769095 | Medical Image Analysis |
| PitVis-2023 challenge: Workflow recognition in videos of endoscopic pituitary surgery. | PitVis-2023挑战赛：内窥镜下垂体手术视频中的工作流程识别。 | Das Adrito, Khan Danyal Z, Psychogyios Dimitrios, Zhang Yitong, Hanrahan John G et al. | Medical image analysis (2025) | The field of computer vision applied to videos of minimally invasive surgery is ever-growing. Workflow recognition pertains to the automated recognition of various aspects of a surgery, including: which surgical steps are performed; and which surgical instruments are used. This information can later be used to assist clinicians when learning the surgery or during live surgery. The Pituitary Vision (PitVis) 2023 Challenge tasks the community to step and instrument recognition in videos of endoscopic pituitary surgery. This is a particularly challenging task when compared to other minimally invasive surgeries due to: the smaller working space, which limits and distorts vision; and higher frequency of instrument and step switching, which requires more precise model predictions. Participants were provided with 25-videos, with results presented at the MICCAI-2023 conference as part of the Endoscopic Vision 2023 Challenge in Vancouver, Canada, on 08-Oct-2023. There were 18-submissions from 9-teams across 6-countries, using a variety of deep learning models. The top performing model for step recognition utilised a transformer based architecture, uniquely using an autoregressive decoder with a positional encoding input. The top performing model for instrument recognition utilised a spatial encoder followed by a temporal encoder, which uniquely used a 2-layer temporal architecture. In both cases, these models outperformed purely spatial based models, illustrating the importance of sequential and temporal information. This PitVis-2023 therefore demonstrates state-of-the-art computer vision models in minimally invasive surgery are transferable to a new dataset. Benchmark results are provided in the paper, and the dataset is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/26531686. | 计算机视觉在微创手术视频中的应用领域正在不断扩展。工作流识别涉及手术各方面的自动化识别，包括：执行了哪些手术步骤；使用了哪些手术器械。这些信息后续可用于辅助临床医生学习手术或进行实时手术。垂体视觉（PitVis）2023挑战赛要求参赛者在内镜垂体手术视频中完成步骤和器械识别任务。与其他微创手术相比，这项任务尤为困难，原因在于：手术操作空间更小，限制并扭曲了视野；器械和步骤切换频率更高，需要模型预测更为精准。主办方提供了25段手术视频，比赛结果于2023年10月8日在加拿大温哥华举行的MICCAI-2023会议"内窥镜视觉2023挑战赛"环节公布。来自6个国家9支团队的18份参赛方案采用了各类深度学习模型。步骤识别表现最佳的模型采用基于Transformer的架构，其创新性在于使用带有位置编码输入的自回归解码器。器械识别最优模型则采用空间编码器与时间编码器串联的结构，其独特之处在于使用双层时间架构。两种模型均优于纯空间模型，印证了序列信息和时序信息的重要性。PitVis-2023由此证明，微创手术中最先进的计算机视觉模型可迁移至新数据集。论文中提供了基准测试结果，数据集已公开发布于：https://doi.org/10.5522/04/26531686。 | 40769094 | Medical Image Analysis |

| Controllable Mask Diffusion Model for medical annotation synthesis with semantic information extraction. | 可控掩码扩散模型用于结合语义信息提取的医学标注合成。 | Heo Chanyeong, Jung Jaehee | Computers in biology and medicine (2025) | Medical segmentation, a prominent task in medical image analysis utilizing artificial intelligence, plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and depends heavily on the quality of the training data. However, the availability of sufficient data is constrained by strict privacy regulations associated with medical data. To mitigate this issue, research on data augmentation has gained significant attention. Medical segmentation tasks require paired datasets consisting of medical images and annotation images, also known as mask images, which represent lesion areas or radiological information within the medical images. Consequently, it is essential to apply data augmentation to both image types. This study proposes a Controllable Mask Diffusion Model, a novel approach capable of controlling and generating new masks. This model leverages the binary structure of the mask to extract semantic information, namely, the mask's size, location, and count, which is then applied as multi-conditional input to a diffusion model via a regressor. Through the regressor, newly generated masks conform to the input semantic information, thereby enabling input-driven controllable generation. Additionally, a technique that analyzes correlation within semantic information was devised for large-scale data synthesis. The generative capacity of the proposed model was evaluated against real datasets, and the model's ability to control and generate new masks based on previously unseen semantic information was confirmed. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the model was demonstrated by augmenting the data with the generated data, applying it to segmentation tasks, and comparing the performance with and without augmentation. Additionally, experiments were conducted on single-label and multi-label masks, yielding superior results for both types. This demonstrates the potential applicability of this study to various areas within the medical field. | 医学分割作为人工智能在医学影像分析中的一项重要任务，在计算机辅助诊断中发挥着关键作用，其效果高度依赖于训练数据的质量。然而，医疗数据受严格隐私法规限制，难以获取充足样本。为解决这一问题，数据增强研究受到广泛关注。医学分割任务需要由医学影像和标注图像（即掩膜图像）组成的配对数据集，这些掩膜图像表征了医学影像中的病变区域或放射学信息。因此，必须同时对两种图像进行数据增强。本研究提出了一种可控制掩膜扩散模型，这种创新方法能够控制并生成新掩膜。该模型利用掩膜的二元结构提取语义信息（包括大小、位置和数量），通过回归器将其作为多条件输入应用于扩散模型。经回归器处理后，新生成的掩膜能符合输入的语义信息，从而实现输入驱动的可控生成。此外，还开发了一种分析语义信息相关性的技术，用于大规模数据合成。通过真实数据集评估了所提模型的生成能力，并验证了模型基于未见语义信息进行可控生成的能力。进一步地，通过将生成数据用于增强数据集并应用于分割任务，比较增强前后的性能差异，证实了模型的实际应用价值。在单标签和多标签掩膜上的实验均取得了优异结果，表明该研究可拓展应用于医学领域的多个方向。 | 40768914 | Medical Image Analysis |

This article will undergo copyediting, layout, and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content. Purpose To develop and validate MRSegmentator, a retrospective cross-modality deep learning model for multiorgan segmentation of MRI scans. Materials and Methods This retrospective study trained MRSegmentator on 1,200 manually annotated UK Biobank Dixon MRI sequences (50 participants), 221 in-house abdominal MRI sequences (177 patients), and 1228 CT scans from the TotalSegmentator-CT dataset. A human-in-the-loop annotation workflow leveraged cross-modality transfer learning from an existing CT segmentation model to segment 40 anatomic structures. The model's performance was evaluated on 900 MRI sequences from 50 participants in the German National Cohort (NAKO), 60 MRI sequences from AMOS22 dataset, and 29 MRI sequences from TotalSegmentator-MRI. Reference standard manual annotations were used for comparison. Metrics to assess segmentation quality included Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical analyses included organ-and sequence-specific mean ± SD reporting and two-sided t tests for demographic effects. Results 139 participants were evaluated; demographic information was available for 70 (mean age 52.7 years ± 14.0 [SD], 36 female). Across all test datasets, MRSegmentator demonstrated high class wise DSC for well-defined organs (lungs: 0.81-0.96, heart: 0.81-0.94) and organs with anatomic variability (liver: 0.82-0.96, kidneys: 0.77-0.95). Smaller structures showed lower DSC (portal/splenic veins: 0.64-0.78, adrenal glands: 0.56-0.69). The average DSC on the external testing using NAKO data, ranged from 0.85 ± 0.08 for T2-HASTE to 0.91 ± 0.05 for in-phase sequences. The model generalized well to CT, achieving mean DSC of 0.84 ± 0.12 on AMOS CT data. Conclusion MRSegmentator accurately segmented 40 anatomic structures on MRI and generalized to CT; outperforming existing open-source tools.
