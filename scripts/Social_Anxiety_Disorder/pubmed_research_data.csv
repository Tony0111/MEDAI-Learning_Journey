The Relationship Between Anxiety and Employment Status in a German Working-Age Population: Findings on Sex-Specific Prevalence Rates and Associated Factors of Anxiety From the LIFE-Adult-Study.,"Görres Charlyn, Pabst Alexander, Zülke Andrea E, Glaesmer Heide, Hinz Andreas et al.",Depression and anxiety (2025),"Introduction: Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental illnesses worldwide, with a 12-month prevalence rate of 14%-15.3%. Prior research has demonstrated a correlation between unemployment and impaired mental health. The primary objective of this study is to examine the relationship between anxiety and employment status in Germany. Methods: The sample consisted of 4885 working-age participants (18-65 years) from the baseline survey of a population-based cohort study. Anxiety was assessed using the General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). Employment status was divided into four groups: full-time employment (FTE group), part-time employment (PTE group), ALG I (ALG I group, being unemployed receiving entitlement-based benefits), and ALG II (ALG II group, being unemployed receiving means-tested benefits). Negative binomial regressions were conducted to examine the association between anxiety, employment status, sociodemographic variables (age, sex, marital status, and education), and social resources (Lubben Social Network Scale 6 [LSNS-6]). Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms (FTE group: 5.0%, PTE group: 4.8%, ALG I group: 2.7%, and ALG II group: 17.6%) differed between employment status groups. The ALG II group exhibited a markedly elevated prevalence compared to all other groups (p  < 0.001). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was higher among females in the FTE group (7.6%) compared to males (2.9%) in the same category (p  < 0.001). The initial regression model indicated a statistically significant association between anxiety symptoms and the ALG II group (p  < 0.001) and the PTE group (p=0.006). After including additional variables, this effect maintained its statistical significance. Factors associated with a higher risk of anxiety symptoms were female sex (p  < 0.001), low educational level (p=0.007), and less social resources (p  < 0.001). Conclusion: Unemployed individuals who receive ALG II are at the highest risk of developing anxiety symptoms among those who are able to work. These findings suggest the need for targeted psychosocial and occupational support for unemployed individuals receiving ALG II.",40771399,Social Anxiety Disorder

Balancing mental health through predictive modeling for healthcare workers during public health crises.,"Wang Jiana, Feng Lin, Meng Nana, Yang Cong, Cai Fanfan et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"During public health emergencies such as SARS, Ebola, and COVID-19, healthcare workers (HCWs) are often on the front lines, placing them at increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes, particularly depression and anxiety. Despite this risk, there remains a scarcity of research focused on developing predictive models to forecast the depression and anxiety levels of healthcare workers under challenging conditions. A total of 349 HCWs were selected from a Tertiary Grade-A hospital in the city of Shenyang, Liaoning Province in China. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, respectively. This study employed a random forest classifier (RFC) to predict depression and anxiety levels of HCWs from three perspectives: individual, interpersonal, and institutional with SHAP values to assess the contribution of factors. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed to address the issue of imbalanced data distribution. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among HCWs was 28.37% and 33.52%, respectively. The prediction model was developed using a training dataset (70%) and a test dataset (30%). The area under the curve (AUC) for depression and anxiety was 0.88 and 0.72, respectively. Additionally, the mean values of the 10-fold cross-validation results were 0.77 for the depression prediction model and 0.79 for the anxiety prediction model. For the depression prediction model, the top ten most significant predictive factors were: burnout, resilience, emotional labor, adaptability, working experience (< 1 year), being a physician, social support, average work time last week (9-11 h), age (28-30 years), age (31-35 years). For the anxiety prediction model, the top ten most significant predictive factors were: burnout, adaptability, emotional labor, age (31-35 years), average work time last week (9-11 h), resilience, being a physician, social support, working experience (< 1 year), and being female. It is essential to develop interventions that provide support both before and after a public health emergency, aiming at mitigating symptoms of depression and anxiety. The machine learning models in this study, using innovative SMOTE methodology to balance datasets with smaller sample sizes, identified key leverage points to prevent depression and anxiety among frontline HCWs, including mitigating burnout among HCWs, bolstering their resilience and adaptability, and ensuring reasonable work hours.",40770397,Social Anxiety Disorder

"Herbal Medicines in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Therapeutic Potential, Plant Components, and Dosage Guidelines.","Aldekhail Nasser M, Khojah Hanan, Alsaadoun Nouf Humoud, Al-Sanea Mohammad M, Alshammari Saleh B et al.",Alternative therapies in health and medicine (2025),"Background • Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), marked by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, significantly impacts the quality of life for kids and caregivers. Herbal medicines help manage symptoms, yet no comprehensive review has collectively summarized recent evidence (2018-mid-2025). Methods • This narrative review utilized searches across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify studies published on herbal medicines for ASD. Inclusion criteria prioritized clinical trials and preclinical studies detailing plant bioactive compounds, dosing, and mechanisms. Key Findings • Prominent herbs include Bacopa monnieri, which can enhance cognitive flexibility via bacosides; Curcuma longa (curcumin), which can reduce oxidative stress and repetitive behaviors; and Green Tea Extract (luteolin), which can modulate neuroinflammation. Cannabinoids show modest improvements in sleep and social engagement, while Ginkgo biloba improves cerebral blood flow. Passionflower and Valerian Root alleviate anxiety and hyperactivity through GABAergic pathways, and probiotic-fermented herbal combinations target gut-brain axis dysfunction. Ashwagandha demonstrates neuroprotective effects in preclinical trials. Clinical Implications • Herbal therapies may address core ASD symptoms (anxiety and hyperactivity) and comorbidities (sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal issues). However, standardization of herbal formulations and rigorous dosing protocols are needed. Integrative approaches combining herbs with behavioral therapies show accepted synergistic potential but require further validation. While herbal medicine may offer supportive benefits, it should never be intended to replace other evidence-based therapies (e.g., applied behavior analysis and speech therapy). Future Directions • Large-scale randomized clinical trials are crucial to confirming efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing. Research must address herb-drug interactions, long-term effects, and biomarkers for personalized treatment.",40768551,Social Anxiety Disorder

Videoconferencing-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder: a randomised controlled trial.,"Winter Halaina R, Norton Alice R, Wootton Bethany M",Cognitive behaviour therapy (2025),"Videoconferencing-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (vCBT) has the potential to overcome barriers to accessing treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). The present study examines the efficacy and acceptability of vCBT for SAD in a randomised controlled trial. Seventy-eight participants were randomised to a vCBT condition or waitlist control group (61.8% female, 34.2% male, 3.9% non-binary; Mage = 39.19, SD = 12.28). On the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and Social Phobia Scale-short form (SIAS-6; SPS-6), vCBT within-group analyses indicated large effect sizes from pre-treatment to post-treatment on the SIAS-6 (Cohen's d = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.45-1.41) and SPS-6 (d = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.41-1.37). The between-group effect size at post-treatment was large on the SPS-6 (d = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.51-1.47) and medium on the SIAS-6 (d = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.09-1.00). At post-treatment, 57% of participants in the vCBT condition no longer met criteria for SAD and 68% at 3-month follow-up. Benchmarking analyses indicated similar treatment effect sizes to in-person CBT for SAD. Participants rated the program as acceptable and treatment completion rates were high. The results suggest that vCBT may be a viable remote treatment option for individuals with SAD.",40768136,Social Anxiety Disorder

Considering the widespread use of the SRS-2-A for a variety of different research and clinical purposes, examining how non-autism-specific factors affect SRS-2-A scores is warranted.",40767897,Social Anxiety Disorder
Treatment Use and Preference in a Diverse Sample of Women With Mood Disorders.,"Ammerman Robert T, Deichen Megan E, Boyd Rhonda C, Longoria Kayla D, Wagner-Schuman Melissa et al.",The Journal of clinical psychiatry (2025),"Objectives: To examine differences in treatment use and preference among women with mood disorders based on race, ethnicity, and type of health insurance. Methods: Women (N = 2,877) with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders were surveyed in primary care and specialty clinics affiliated with the National Network of Depression Centers from January 2018 to December 2020. Logistic regression was employed to examine the probabilities of Black, White, and Hispanic women, who varied on public (government-funded) vs private insurance, using and preferring medication, psychotherapy, or complementary treatments. Results: Black women had lower odds of receiving medications for treatment of all mood disorders, while White women had higher odds. For example, in treatment of depression, the odds ratio (OR) for Black women was 0.435 (P=.011), while the OR for White women was 2.048 (P=.009). Hispanic women had higher odds of using complementary treatments than other women. For example, in treatment of anxiety, their OR was 2.346 (P=.008). Across mood disorders, government-funded (Medicaid/Medicare) coverage was associated with greater use of psychotherapy and complementary treatments (ORs ranging from 1.529 to 5.011) as well as greater medication use for bipolar disorder (OR=5.805, P=.027). Psychotherapy was preferred by the majority of all women (55.5%), although preferences for other treatments differed between racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: Research is needed regarding the degree to which clinicians are offering varied treatments to diverse women with mood disorders and how clinicians consider women's preferences. Results highlight the necessity for treatment that integrates culturally based values and preferences, along with policies that ensure treatment access for women who are privately insured.",40767838,Social Anxiety Disorder

Adults diagnosed with COVID-19 through real-time PCR/serological tests were invited to participate. The online questionnaires were distributed at different times to analyze and compare SARS-CoV-2 variants considering the period of prevalence of these variants in Brazil. A total of 846 participants were included, of whom 539 were diagnosed before the Omicron variant. In total, 47.28% were vaccinated with at least two doses. The prevalence of oral manifestations was 52.6% (95%CI: 49.23-55.95), and the most common manifestations included taste disorder (38.06%; 95%CI: 34.85-41.38), xerostomia (17.61%; 95%CI: 15.19-20.32), and halitosis (11.58%; 95%CI: 9.59-13.92). The prevalence of persistent symptoms in post-COVID-19 was 12.1% (95%CI: 10.0-14.4) for taste disorder and 5.4% (95%CI: 4.1-7.1) for xerostomia. A significant association was found between females and persistent taste disorder (p = 0.0084) and oral manifestation and depression/anxiety (OR = 1.855, 95%CI: 1.267-2.717, p = 0.002), worse oral hygiene (OR = 1.729, 95%CI: 1.189-2.516, p = 0.004), and medication use (OR = 1.630, 95%CI: 1.123-2.367, p = 0.010) (p < 0.0001). In the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, compared with the Omicron variant, taste disorder and xerostomia were less present when toothbrushing habits remained unchanged or improved (p < 0.0001). Oral manifestations in patients with COVID-19 were associated with depression/anxiety, worse oral hygiene, and medication, all of which reinforce its multifactorial etiopathogenesis.",40767661,Social Anxiety Disorder

Freedom and mental health: an overview of the impact of fundamental rights on psychological wellbeing.,Mohiyeddini Changiz,Frontiers in psychology (2025),"Freedom, in its many forms, is a cornerstone of human rights. These include, among others, freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of assembly, and freedom from discrimination. However, these freedoms are not only legal or political constructs but are also deeply embedded in the socio-cultural, religious, political, historical, and hence psychological composition of human beings. Rather than examining all of the many manifestations of freedom at once, this paper aims to explore the impact of a few specific freedoms-including freedom of speech, thought, assembly, movement, and protection from arbitrary arrest-on mental health and wellbeing. The objective of this commentary is to summarize existing evidence on how these freedoms support mental health and to highlight areas where the restriction of freedoms is linked to psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, it also discusses the debilitating effects of self-censorship, discrimination, lack of access to education, and arbitrary detention on mental health. Despite substantial evidence underscoring the importance of freedoms for mental wellbeing, there remains a pressing need for comprehensive research to understand the complex associations between different aspects of freedom and their individual and collective impact on mental health. The discussion herein aims to provide a foundation for future studies and to inform policy interventions that protect both freedom and psychological wellbeing.",40766012,Social Anxiety Disorder
Exploring the Sociodemographic Factors Influencing Women's Experiences With Domestic Violence and Their Help-Seeking Behaviors at the National Guard Health Hospitals.,"Alsupiany Awateif O, Aseeri Hatem, Ababtain Hind A, Shamou Jinan Z, Abusulaiman Roaa M et al.",Cureus (2025),"Background Domestic violence is recognized as a public health issue. It has adverse impacts on women's physical, mental, and reproductive well-being. This study aimed to ascertain the sociodemographic attributes of domestic violence in women who seek help at the National Guard Health (NGH) hospitals, as well as examine the psychological condition of the victims. Methods This was a retrospective-prospective, descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in four regions in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Madinah, and Al-Ahsa). The data collection tool was a questionnaire consisting mainly of three sections (the sociodemographic characteristics, abuse characteristics, and victim's knowledge and ways to get help), developed and validated by the study authors and field experts. Data were collected from the electronic data extraction system (BestCare) and through structured phone interviews conducted by a well-trained research team. Results A total of 292 women participated, with a median age of 31 years (IQR, 26-38). A percentage of 8.5% reported suffering violence from many people. Husbands were the foremost perpetrators (196, 67.1%), and physical violence represented 166 cases (57%). Among the victims, the prevalence of anxiety/spectrum disorder increased from 15 (5.2%) to 22 (7.5%); 59 (20.1%) reported suicide attempts, while 18 (6.1%) had suicidal ideation. Almost one-third (112, 33.3%) of the victims were referred to social service follow-up, 74 (22%) to the family therapy clinic, 33 (9.8%) to the psychiatry outpatient department, and 28 (8.3%) were admitted for protection. Violence was ongoing in 36 (12.3%) of the victims; hospitals and police were the primary sources of getting help (56, 18.4%). Filing a legal complaint and involving family members were cited as the most helpful way to help stop the violence, followed by health facility intervention as the next most beneficial modality by 34 (11.4%) of the victims, in which psychiatry was the most helpful. Victims know about the domestic violence team services mainly through official referrals from other teams, while the media has almost no role. Conclusion Our findings showed that domestic violence was prevalent, notably in the form of physical abuse. Most victims were the same age or younger than their perpetrators, and some had the same education level. Most of the perpetrators were military-employed husbands. The findings also reveal a mixed pattern in how victims of abuse sought help. Suicidal attempts and ideation were also commonplace among the victims. Hospitals and police were the primary sources of help for the victims. Although social media can play a crucial role in raising awareness and providing education, this aspect has often been overlooked.",40765599,Social Anxiety Disorder
Daily associations between peer victimization and anxious affect among adolescents: The role of social threat sensitivity.,"Schacter Hannah L, Marusak Hilary A, Gowatch Leah, Jovanovic Tanja",Development and psychopathology (2025),"Adolescents frequently victimized by peers are two to three times more likely to develop an anxiety disorder than their non-victimized peers. However, the fine-grained mechanisms that explain how peer victimization confers risk for anxiety in adolescents' daily lives are not well-understood. Leveraging an intensive longitudinal design, this study examined same- and cross-day links between peer victimization and anxiety, investigating social threat sensitivity as a potential underlying mechanism. One hundred ninety-five adolescents (Mage = 16.48, SDage = 0.35; 66% female, 27% male, 11% non-binary, identifying with another gender; 48% White, 20% Asian, 15% Black, 17% identifying with another race/ethnicity) completed brief daily assessments of peer victimization, social threat sensitivity, and anxious affect for 14 days. Multilevel analyses indicated that adolescents reported greater anxious affect on days when they experienced peer victimization compared to days without victimization. Although peer victimization did not predict anxious affect the following day, it was associated with increased anxious affect two days later. Social threat sensitivity significantly mediated the same-day, but not cross-day, association between peer victimization and anxious affect, controlling for prior-day threat sensitivity and anxiety. The findings suggest that heightened social vigilance partially accounts for anxious affect in adolescents facing peer victimization in daily life.",40765447,Social Anxiety Disorder
Exploring the nucleus accumbens circuit and oxytocin therapy in a Sapap3 knockout mouse model of trichotillomania.,"Wang Yuan, Yu Jingjing, Ma Rui, Chen Yundong, Lu Shihao et al.",Scientific reports (2025),"Trichotillomania (TTM), an understudied psychiatric disorder, was investigated using Sapap3 knockout (KO) mice to elucidate nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuit dysfunction and oxytocin's therapeutic potential. Under aversive conditions, KO mice exhibited TTM-like behavioral phenotypes compared to wild-type (WT) controls: elevated anxiety-like behavior (reduced total distance 33328.45 ± 6703.97 mm vs. WT 47787.22 ± 12221.33 mm; decreased standing episodes 34.20 ± 19.41 vs. WT 58.10 ± 15.55; increased immobility duration 175.05 ± 54.46 s vs. WT 90.23 ± 70.22 s, all p < 0.05), excessive grooming duration (467.43 ± 94.98 s vs. WT 391.62 ± 86.44 s, p < 0.05), and impaired social interaction characterized by elevated aggression (70 ± 10% victory rate in tube-dominance test vs. WT, p < 0.05). Calcium imaging revealed NAc neuronal hypoactivity (peak ΔF/F0: 2.44 ± 1.67% vs. WT 6.92 ± 2.08%, p < 0.05). Molecular analyses revealed: (1) Dopaminergic signaling alterations (increased dopamine: 26.95 ± 2.04 pg/mL vs. WT 22.43 ± 1.85 pg/mL, p < 0.05; D1 receptor up-regulation 1.29-fold and D2 down-regulation 0.89-fold). (2) Synaptic plasticity disruptions (CREB overexpression: 1.71-fold, p < 0.01; SHANK upregulation: 1.18-fold, p < 0.05). (3) SAPAP3-SHANK3 interaction deficits confirmed by immunofluorescence (compensatory SHANK3 up-regulation 1.46-fold). Oxytocin effects were paradoxical: acute administration exacerbated total grooming duration (550.45 ± 33.65 s vs. KO baseline 467.43 ± 94.98 s, p < 0.05) but reduced grooming bouts (50.80 ± 28.20 vs. 95.30 ± 31.92, p < 0.01) and attenuated aggression (victory rate against WT decreased to 65 ± 5%). Sex-stratified analysis revealed enhanced grooming severity in female KO mice (the grooming duration 526.59 ± 25.69 s vs. male KO 408.26 ± 104.33 s, p < 0.05). These findings highlight NAc circuit dysfunction and complex oxytocin effects in TTM, suggesting therapeutic targets while emphasizing the need for sex-stratified.",40764792,Social Anxiety Disorder
Tommy's National Rainbow Clinic Study: a protocol for a multi-site cohort study to evaluate a specialist antenatal service for women and families following a stillbirth or neonatal death.,"Barron Rebecca L, Tomlinson Emma, Bailey Emilie, Heazell Alexander Ep",BMJ open (2025),"In the UK, each year, approximately 2250 babies are stillborn, and there are an additional 1150 neonatal deaths. The death of a baby before or shortly after birth is a profoundly distressing experience for women and their families and is invariably followed by a period of grief. Most women who have experienced the loss of a baby will embark on another pregnancy, usually within a year. Parents need specialist support from doctors and midwives in a future pregnancy to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and meet care and support needs. The Rainbow Clinic aims to meet these needs and was first established in 2013 at Saint Mary's Hospital, Manchester. Initial studies have shown that this model of care improves pregnancy outcomes, decreases anxiety levels and is associated with a strong social return on investment. The Tommy's National Rainbow Clinic Study aims to evaluate the care provided within this new model, to examine women's experiences of care and identify areas of improvement and measure the impact on pregnancy outcomes for mothers and babies.",40764070,Social Anxiety Disorder

The promotion of health behaviours including physical activity, nutrition, and sleep, and reduction of sedentary behaviour, has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of mental health conditions in adolescents. However, addressing this public health challenge at a population level requires scalable interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth) interventions. However, the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in achieving clinically meaningful mental health improvements for adolescents with emotional, behavioural, or eating disorders remains unclear.

A school-based sample of 3009 adolescents (53.7% female; age range: 12-19 years) and a clinical sample of 162 adolescents diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (70.4% female; age range: 15-18 years) provided information on anxiety experienced and avoidance engaged in during in social events; some participants also reported on another measure of social anxiety and fears of negative and positive evaluation. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model reflecting correlated core social fears, as well as a unidimensional model for general avoidance, as applied to community and clinical participants. These models were invariant based on sex, age-groups (early, middle, and late adolescence), and clinical status. All measures had at least good internal consistency values. Evidence of convergent validity was found based on correlations between the scale's measures and measures of social anxiety and fear of negative and positive evaluation. The Core Social Fears Scale for Adolescents proved to be a psychometrically robust measure for the assessment and characterization of the adolescents' experience of social anxiety.",40759831,Social Anxiety Disorder
Genetic overlap between functional impairment and depression and anxiety symptom severity: evidence from the GLAD Study.,"Skelton Megan, Mundy Jessica, Ter Kuile Abigail R, Adey Brett N, Armour Chérie et al.",Psychological medicine (2025),"Functional impairment in daily activities, such as work and socializing, is part of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and most anxiety disorders.

Assessing executive functioning in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) across the lifespan: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"Harrison Alexandra A, Nguyen Lan, Murphy Karen, Neumann David",Journal of anxiety disorders (2025),"Social anxiety disorder is a pervasive clinical disorder characterised by intense fear and/or avoidance of one or more social situations, and has been linked to deficits in executive functioning performance. However, methodological differences and mixed results have made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from individual studies. The current systematic review and meta-analysis collated the results from 49 studies to examine the link between social anxiety disorder and executive functioning across the lifespan. Findings revealed that individuals with social anxiety performed significantly worse than healthy controls or low social anxiety groups on measures of executive functioning (r = -.15), specifically cognitive flexibility (r = -.20), inhibitory control (r = -.18), and global executive functioning (r = -.17). No significant association was evident between working memory and social anxiety (r = -.06). In addition, the type of measure (self-report vs cognitive task) moderated the relationship between social anxiety and executive functioning. Although age did not moderate the overall relationship, the association between the individual domains of executive functioning and social anxiety differed between youth and adults, which may reflect the different developmental timelines between the domains across the lifespan. The findings offer valuable insight into our understanding of the development of executive functions for individuals with social anxiety and could assist with forming new strategies or interventions to improve daily functioning in this clinical population.",40752129,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Evidence of Disrupted Hippocampal Gray- and White-Matter Development in Adolescent Anxiety Disorders, Independent From Early-Life Stress.","Pedroza-Sotelo Karina, Schwarb Hillary, Auerbach Randy P, Ghosh Satrajit S, Henin Aude et al.",Hippocampus (2025),"Early-life stress and depression among youths are linked to hippocampal gray- and white-matter alterations. Less is known about hippocampal alterations in adolescent anxiety disorders (Anx) or the role that stress or comorbid depressive disorders (Anx + Dep) might play. Here, structural- and diffusion-MRI along with early-life stress-exposure reports were acquired from 197 adolescents (13.58-17.00 years) with Anx, Anx + Dep, and those without (Controls). A normative model externally validated on a large, healthy sample revealed that Anx were more likely than Controls and Anx + Dep to exhibit undersized hippocampal gray-matter volumes for their ages. Volume reductions among Anx were further localized to subfield CA1. No significant gray-matter differences were observed between Anx + Dep and Controls. Standardized probabilistic tractography in hippocampal white-matter pathways demonstrated that, relative to Controls, Anx and Anx + Dep exhibited lower fractional anisotropy specifically in the cingulum-temporal branch. All effects were specific to hippocampal structures. Group differences were not accounted for by early-life stress exposures, despite Anx and Anx + Dep reporting more than Controls. Findings indicated that gray-matter expansion, principally within CA1, may be disrupted among adolescents with anxiety disorders, but not those with comorbid depression. The progressive strengthening of hippocampal-cortical circuits occurring during adolescence may also be disrupted in adolescents with anxiety disorders, regardless of depression.",40751564,Social Anxiety Disorder

Understanding Duchenne muscular dystrophy-associated brain pathology.,"Verhaeg Minou A T, Govaarts Rosanne, van Putten Maaike",Disease models & mechanisms (2025),"The most common neuromuscular disorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in a lack of dystrophin. In addition to severe and progressive muscle wasting, a subset of individuals with DMD experience, to largely varying extents, behavioural and cognitive deficits, including a lower IQ, and neurological comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Neuroimaging studies in individuals with DMD have identified widespread pathology, including structural, physiological and connective alterations. DMD mouse models exhibit a number of DMD-associated behavioural traits, including anxiety, social deficits and learning disabilities, and have been used to investigate DMD brain pathology. Although there are currently no therapies to treat DMD brain pathology, genetic approaches are being developed to restore dystrophin expression. In particular, the exon skipping approach shows promise in ameliorating certain DMD-associated behavioural deficits in preclinical settings. However, the therapeutic potential of postnatal restoration of dystrophin isoforms involved in neurodevelopment is unknown. Furthermore, challenges such as low dystrophin restoration efficacy and translatability from DMD mouse models to the clinic remain to be addressed.",40747772,Social Anxiety Disorder

Profiling of research domain criteria-based behaviors following single prolonged stress in male C57BL/6J mice.,"O'Hara Krysten P, King Savanna M, Penrod Rachel D, Rinker Jennifer A, Mulholland Patrick J","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands) (2025)","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects approximately one in 11 people throughout their lifetime yet current treatment options, such as behavioral therapies or pharmaceuticals, suffer from low medical adherence and often fail to fully address all the symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand maladaptive behaviors in PTSD to guide new treatments. Single-prolonged stress (SPS) is a rodent model of stress that parallels certain human neurophysiological and neurobehavioral changes occurring in PTSD. SPS is a single-day sequential stressor exposure-restraint stress, group forced swim, predator odor exposure, and isoflurane until loss of consciousness-followed by 7 days of stress incubation. Here, we investigated multiple cohorts of male C57BL/6J mice early after SPS and stress incubation (8-10 days) on behavioral tasks (elevated plus maze (EPM), three-chamber sociability, cost-benefit conflict (CBC), home cage behavior, scent avoidance and defensive burying tasks) that test multiple PTSD-related symptoms. Behavioral assessment included efforts to replicate published findings (i.e., EPM) and introducing newer tasks (i.e., CBC) that have not yet been tested in the SPS mouse model. While most of these tasks and standardized metrics failed to capture behavioral differences in SPS-treated male C57BL/6J mice, we did observe deficits in social novelty preference in the stressed mice. These studies add to a growing literature on inconsistencies in behavioral outcomes produced by the mouse SPS paradigm that could be potentially explained by mouse strain or procedural differences. Overall, this study demonstrated that behavior in male C57BL/6J mice were not affected after SPS apart from social novelty preference.",40745687,Social Anxiety Disorder

It leads to development of drug resistance, treatment failure and increased client mortality. This study aimed at assessing patient factors influencing ART defaulting amongst youth living with HIV enrolled on ART in Mzimba District. A quantitative, case-control design was employed, enrolling 411 youths living with HIV (n = 137 cases and n = 274 controls) attending an HIV care clinic. The cases and controls were allotted to the ART clinics proportionally to their number of ART clients. Random sampling techniques were used to recruit both ART defaulters and non-defaulters. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics provided counts, frequencies, proportions, and ranges, while inferential statistics established associations between dependent and independent variables. Patient related factors associated with ART defaulting include: Participants age (p-value: 0.046, Cramer's V: 0.2, OR: 0.663, 95% CI: 0.439-0.902), forgetting appointment date (p-value: < 0.001, OR: 4.213, 95% CL: 2.289-7.755), experiencing ART side effects (p-value: < 0.001, OR: 0.438, 95% CL: 0.286-0.672), taking other drugs apart from ART (p-value 0.008, OR: 0.059, 95% CL: 0.007-0.479).

Mental Health Status of Caregivers of Children with ASD in Mainland China: The Impact of Stigma and Social Support in the Post-COVID-19 Era.,"Chen Zile, Xu Xiaoxuan, Tian Jinlai",Journal of autism and developmental disorders (2025),"Caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face significant psychological distress due to stigma, which impacts their mental health and life satisfaction. However, the specific effects of courtesy stigma, vicarious stigma, and affiliate stigma, along with the role of social support, remain underexplored. This study aims to examine the relationships among different types of stigma, social support, mental health (anxiety and depression), and life satisfaction among caregivers in mainland China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 123 caregivers of children with ASD from two cities in mainland China. Participants completed validated scales assessing stigma perception, social support, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction. Correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, and Bootstrap mediation analysis were employed to test the hypothesized relationships. All three types of stigma were positively associated with anxiety and depression, and negatively associated with life satisfaction. Social support significantly buffered the adverse effects of stigma and partially mediated the relationship between stigma and caregivers' well-being. Moreover, social support played a protective role in mitigating the psychological distress caused by stigma, though it could not eliminate its adverse effects. These findings highlight the pressing need for more effective social support systems, increased public awareness, and early interventions to reduce stigma-related distress. Enhancing support for caregivers of children with ASD is essential for improving their mental health and overall life satisfaction.",40742677,Social Anxiety Disorder
Do You Like Me? Differences in Learning Social Cues in Adolescents with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD).,"Forrest Claire L, Gibson Jenny L, Button Katherine S, Halligan Sarah L, St Clair Michelle C",Journal of autism and developmental disorders (2025),"The pathways to the documented increased social and emotional difficulties in individuals with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) are unclear. We explored whether differences in social evaluation could account for social and emotional difficulties in adolescents with DLD using a computerized social evaluation task. Twenty-four adolescents with DLD were matched with twenty-six adolescents with typical language development (TLD) (Mage = 13.5 years, SE = 2.38; n = 18 female). They completed the Social Evaluation Learning Task (SELT; Button et al., 2015) which measures how quickly people learn the computer likes or dislikes either them or someone else. Adolescents and parents reported social and emotional functioning. Adolescents with DLD had poorer social understanding, in that they took longer to learn that the computer disliked them. They learned similarly to their TLD when the computer liked them and someone else. Adolescents with DLD also had higher self-reported anxiety and more parent reported emotional and peer problems; however, there was no mediational effect of social evaluation on socioemotional difficulties. This study demonstrates that adolescent with DLD have specific difficulties in interpreting cues that they are disliked by others but are just as good at understanding when they are liked. The differences seen in their social evaluation skills did not account for their increased socioemotional difficulties. This social evaluation bias might explain previous findings of good self-rated social competence while other ratings indicate social difficulties.

Data-Driven Approach to Dynamic Resting State Functional Connectivity in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: An ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Study.,"Tomas Carissa W, Fitzgerald Jacklynn M, Baird C Lexi, Haswell Courtney C, Abdallah Chadi G et al.",Human brain mapping (2025),"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with aberrations in brain networks in the absence of a given cognitive demand or task, called resting-state networks. Prior work has focused on disruption in the static functional connectivity (FC) among specific regions constrained by a priori hypotheses. However, dynamic FC, an approach that examines brain network characteristics over time, may provide a more sensitive measure to understand the network properties underlying dysfunction in PTSD. Further, using a data-driven analytic approach may reveal the contribution of other larger network disturbances beyond those revealed by hypothesis-driven examinations of ROIs or canonical networks. Therefore, the current study used group independent components analysis (ICA) and graph theory principles to identify, characterize, and subsequently compare brain network dynamics and recurrent connectivity states in a large sample of trauma exposed individuals (N = 1035) with and without PTSD from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD workgroup. Neither static FC nor dynamic FC results showed robust differences between groups. There were also no group differences in dwell time or number of transitions of recurrent connectivity states. This multi-cohort sample with heterogenous trauma types and demographic features offers a significantly larger scale approach than prior literature with smaller homogenous trauma cohorts. Heterogeneity of PTSD, especially within diffuse brain networks, may not be captured by evaluating only diagnostic groups, further work should be done to evaluate brain network dynamics with respect to specific symptom profiles and trauma types.",40736265,Social Anxiety Disorder

Three co-produced, mixed-methods studies are reported, investigating the evidential quality, lived experiences and perceived credibility of people who stammer (PWS) as witnesses. In pre-registered Study 1, PWS recalled as much correct information as non-stammering witnesses overall. However, during the free - but not cued - recall interview phase, PWS provided fewer correct details. A reflexive thematic analysis of participants' post-testimony reflections captured how PWS experienced a cyclical relationship between communicative pressure, anxiety over listener misperceptions and stammer severity, which they navigated either by employing avoidance strategies at the expense of testimony or by speaking through their stammer. In pre-registered Study 2, mock jurors rated PWS as less confident yet more likeable and trustworthy than non-stammering witnesses.

Taxonomy of anxiety disorders-a comparison of ICD‑10 and ICD‑11.,"Domschke Katharina, Zwanzger Peter",Der Nervenarzt (2025),"With the introduction of the 11th revision of the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), structural and content-related adjustments to the diagnostic guidelines for anxiety disorders were made, which are presented in this review article. Previously classified as ""phobic disorders"" and ""other anxiety disorders"" within the group ""neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders"", in ICD-11 ""anxiety- or fear-related disorders"" now constitute a separate group. The core diagnoses of agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are retained, with the modification that agoraphobia and panic disorder can now be diagnosed separately and comorbidly. Within the framework of the lifespan perspective, separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been moved to the group ""anxiety- or fear-related disorders"". The diagnosis ""mixed anxiety and depressive disorder"" is now classified as ""mixed depressive and anxiety disorder"" in the group ""affective disorders"". In accordance with the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‑5), it is possible to code isolated panic attacks in addition to other mental or somatic disorders. Overall, ICD-11 follows the DSM‑5 classification of anxiety- and fear-related disorders in many respects. Furthermore, the omission of subcategorizations and a precise minimum number of required symptoms simplify the diagnostic criteria. Future studies will need to address questions regarding the diagnostic accuracy, clinical practicability and further operationalization of the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for anxiety- or fear-related disorders.",40728738,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Associations of insecure adult attachment style, trauma-related social cognition, and emotion regulation difficulties with PTSD symptom severity among first responders who served during Hurricane Harvey.","Leonard Samuel J, Venta Amanda, Derrick Jaye, Anderson-Fletcher Elizabeth, Vujanovic Anka A",Cognitive behaviour therapy (2025),"First responders play a vital role in the response to natural disasters and are at a disproportionate risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following these events. The association between attachment style and PTSD is well-established and has been documented among first responders. Understanding the social cognitive and affective factors implicated in the association between insecure adult attachment style and PTSD symptoms among first responders has the potential to inform specialized treatments for this population. The present investigation examined the serial indirect effect of insecure adult attachment style (i.e. attachment avoidance; attachment anxiety) on PTSD symptom severity through trauma-related social cognition and emotion regulation difficulties (ERD). The sample was comprised of 115 first responders (Mage = 42.25, SD = 10.38, 80.0% male) who served during Hurricane Harvey and were recruited to complete an online survey in 2022. Attachment avoidance was indirectly related to PTSD symptom severity via the sequential effects of trauma-related social cognition and ERD (β=.13, SE = .07, CI = .02-.29). The model including attachment anxiety as a statistical predictor was not significant (β = .10, SE = .07, CI = -.01-.27). These findings suggest that there is value in examining the role of social processes and emotion regulatory factors among first responders to inform evidence-based PTSD intervention efforts.",40728205,Social Anxiety Disorder
Enhancing the efficacy and user experience of virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder: A pilot study.,"Aunjitsakul Warut, Anantapong Kanthee, Wiwattanaworaset Pakawat, Jiraphan Aimorn, Teetharatkul Teerapat et al.",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine (2025),"BackgroundSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) significantly impairs social functioning. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) offers a promising treatment by providing a controlled, customizable environment. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy and user experience of a VRET program.MethodsThe study was conducted in two phases: Phase I with the general population and Phase II with individuals diagnosed with SAD at a university hospital. Social anxiety, depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale at three time points: before, immediately after, and two weeks post-VRET. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire assessed user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and any VR-induced symptoms. Our VRET program utilized graded exposure techniques within culturally relevant social scenarios.ResultsBoth groups exhibited significant reductions in social anxiety levels following VRET sessions (ps < 0.01) compared to pre-VRET levels. However, individuals with SAD reported increased social anxiety at the two-week follow-up, while the general population maintained their improvement. The VR software received satisfactory ratings for usability, safety, and acceptability.ConclusionThis program demonstrates potential for reducing social anxiety and provides a satisfactory VR experience, supporting its feasibility for individuals with SAD in a developing country. Given the pilot nature and limited sample size, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Future research with larger samples and repeated sessions is needed to enhance efficacy and ensure long-term benefits. Comprehensive treatment protocols, including tutorials, relaxation techniques, and stress monitoring, are recommended for optimal outcomes.",40726377,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Increased Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders in Children with RASopathies: Comparing NF1, Noonan Syndrome Spectrum Disorder, and the General Population.","Serur Yaffa, Russo Odeya, McGhee Chloe Alexa, Green Tamar",Genes (2025),"Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome spectrum disorders (NSSD) are the most common RASopathies, resulting from germline mutations that affect the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. Both are associated with increased risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, yet few studies have used structured diagnostic interviews to compare their psychiatric comorbidities. Methods: We conducted clinician-administered DSM-5 diagnostic assessments (KSADS) in 123 children with RASopathies (NF1 = 29, NSSD = 94; ages 5-15). Diagnosis prevalence was compared within each group and to population-based estimates. Results: Psychiatric diagnoses were highly prevalent, at 79.3% in NF1 and 76.6% in NSSD, with ADHD (NF1 = 72.4%, NSSD = 51.1%) and anxiety disorders (NF1 = 37.9% and NSSD = 43.6%) being the most common, rates substantially higher than those reported in general population estimates. Behavioral and sleep disorders were identified in approximately 25% of both groups. Notably, social anxiety disorder was identified in 14.9% of NSSD but not in NF1. Full-scale IQ did not significantly differ by diagnosis status. Specific anxiety disorders, elimination disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder were characterized, expanding the known psychiatric phenotype of RASopathies. Conclusions: Children with NF1 and NSSD demonstrate similarly high rates of ADHD, anxiety, and behavioral disorders compared to the general population; in addition, we report sleep disorders in NSSD and characterize psychiatric disorders not previously described in RASopathies. The shared psychiatric profiles may reflect the common effect of RAS-MAPK pathway dysregulation on psychiatric outcomes. These findings highlight the need for early, syndrome-informed mental health screening and intervention in the clinical care of individuals with RASopathies.",40725498,Social Anxiety Disorder
A Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H MRS) Pilot Study Revealing Altered Glutamatergic and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)ergic Neurotransmission in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).,"Elsaid Sonja, Wang Ruoyu, Kloiber Stefan, Desmond Kimberly L, Le Foll Bernard",International journal of molecular sciences (2025),"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by fear and avoidance of social situations. Considering the reduced availability of conventional therapies, we aimed to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms in SAD by evaluating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and other neurometabolites (including glutamate + glutamine/glutamix (Glx), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), myo-inositol (mI), total choline (tCho), and total creatine (tCr) in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the insula). In this pilot study, we recruited 26 (age: 25.3 ± 5.0 years; 61.5% female) individuals with SAD and 26 (age: 25.1 ± 4.4 years; 61.5% female) sex-age-matched controls. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found that compared to the controls, GABA+ macromolecular signal (GABA+) in dlPFC (t = 2.63; p = 0.012) and Glx in the insula (Mann-Whitney U = 178.3; p = 0.024) were higher in the participants with SAD. However, no between-group differences were observed in dmPFC/ACC (t = 0.39; p = 0.699). Increased GABA+ in dlPFC could be explained by aberrant GABA transporters. In the insula, increased Glx may be associated with the dysfunction of glutamate transporters or decreased activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase in the GABAergic inhibitory neurons. However, these proposed mechanisms need to be further investigated in SAD.",40725163,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Effect of Maternal Dietary DHA and Prenatal Stress Mouse Model on Autistic-like Behaviors, Lipid Peroxidation Activity, and GABA Expression in Offspring Pups.","Woo Taeseon, Ahmed Nick I, Appenteng Michael K, King Candice, Li Runting et al.",International journal of molecular sciences (2025),"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by restricted social communication and repetitive behaviors. Prenatal stress is critical in neurodevelopment and increases risk for ASD, particularly in those with greater genetic susceptibility to stress. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is one of the most abundant ω-3 fatty acids in the membrane phospholipids of the mammalian brain, and dietary DHA plays an important role in brain development and maintenance of brain structure. In this study, we investigated whether peri-natal supplementation of DHA can alleviate autistic-like behaviors in a genetic risk/stress mouse model and how it alters lipid peroxidation activity and GABAergic system gene expression in the forebrain. Pregnant heterozygous serotonin transporter knockout (SERT-KO) and wild-type (WT) dams were placed in either non-stressed control conditions or chronic variable stress (CVS) conditions and fed either a control diet or a DHA-rich (1% by weight) diet. Offspring of each group were assessed for anxiety and autism-associated behavior at post-natal day 60 using an open field test, elevated plus maze test, repetitive behavior, and the 3-chamber social approach test. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based method was used to follow changes in levels of lipid peroxidation products in the cerebral cortex. Male offspring of prenatally stressed SERT-het KO dams exhibited decreased social preference behaviors and increased repetitive grooming behaviors compared to WT control offspring. Moreover, DHA supplementation in male SERT-het mice decreased frequency of grooming behaviors albeit showing no associated effects on social behaviors. Regardless of stress conditions, supplementation of DHA to the WT mice did not result in alterations in grooming nor social interaction in the offspring. Furthermore, no apparent changes were observed in the lipid peroxidation products comparing the stressed and non-stressed brains. Gad2 was downregulated in the cortex of female offspring of prenatally stressed SERT-KO dams, and this change appeared to be rescued by DHA supplementation in offspring. Gad2 was upregulated in the striatum of male offspring of prenatally stressed SERT-KO dams, but DHA did not significantly alter the expression compared to the control diet condition.",40724979,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Thiamine Compounds Alleviate Oxidative Stress, Over-Expression of Pro-Inflammatory Markers and Behavioral Abnormalities in a Mouse Predation Model of PTSD.","Strekalova Tatyana, Gorlova Anna, Costa-Nunes Joao, Litavrin Aleksandr, de Munter Johannes P M et al.",International journal of molecular sciences (2025),"Experiences of life-threatening stimuli can induce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with long-lasting behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities. Despite its increased global incidence, the current treatment options for PTSD remain limited, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. As oxidative stress and neuroinflammation contribute to PTSD, the use of powerful antioxidants such as thiamine (B1 vitamin) compounds may counteract disease development. Young C57BL/6 mice received thiamine or benfotiamine in drinking water (each at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day) for 21 days, and for the last five days, they were subjected to rat exposure. Mice were studied for anxiety-like behavior, exploration, locomotion, grooming, social interactions, pain sensitivity, brain changes in protein carbonyl (PC), total glutathione (TG), and gene expression of distress and inflammation markers. Rat exposure induced anxiety-like behavior, excessive grooming, and alteration in locomotion, along with other abnormalities. Stressed, untreated mice had elevated levels of PC and TG in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum and increased expression of Il-1β, Tnf, c-Fos, Cox-1, and Cox-2. Treatment with thiamine or benfotiamine significantly ameliorated most of these changes in the stressed groups. Thus, thiamine compounds may have therapeutic potential in patients with PTSD, owing to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",40724875,Social Anxiety Disorder
Depression and Anxiety Outcomes Among Young Adults Who Self-Reported Experiencing Commercial Sexual Exploitation in Adolescence.,"Godoy Sarah M, Englert Adam R, Mazursky Nofar, Prout Luisa, Hall William J",International journal of environmental research and public health (2025),"The commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) of children is a distinct form of sexual trauma, resulting in immediate mental health issues. Few studies explore associations between family-level factors in adolescence and health outcomes in adulthood among this population. Utilizing a nationally representative dataset, we explored differences and associations between mental health outcomes and domains of the Family Health Development framework among respondents who self-reported CSE (N = 502; mean age = 15.03, SD = 1.34; 67% male; 50% white). We conducted ordinary least squares and binary logistic regressions using a hierarchical approach to analyze the CES-D depression scale, anxious personality scale, and self-reported diagnoses of depression and anxiety/panic disorder. At Wave IV, when participants were aged 24-32, 20% of participants reported ever having a diagnosis of depression, and 12% reported ever having an anxiety/panic disorder diagnosis. Family receipt of public assistance during adolescence significantly predicted depression and anxiety symptoms in adulthood, highlighting associations between family structure and mental health. Gender and race significantly predicted anxiety symptoms and having a diagnosis of depression and anxiety/panic disorder. Findings underscore the need for targeted training and comprehensive health screenings for providers to better understand and address the long-term mental health needs of CSE-impacted groups.",40724129,Social Anxiety Disorder
Empower-Grief for Relatives of Cancer Patients: Implementation and Findings from an Exploratory Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Neto David Dias, Coelho Alexandra, Silva Ana Nunes da, Marques Teresa Garcia, Albuquerque Sara","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Grief reactions among relatives of palliative care patients are often overlooked, with most interventions targeting Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) rather than its prevention. Few interventions have been developed for individuals at risk. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Empower-Grief, a selective intervention designed to address early problematic grief reactions and to explore predictors of its effectiveness. This exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared Empower-Grief with Treatment as Usual (TAU) among relatives or caregivers of palliative and oncological patients at risk of developing PGD. A total of 46 participants were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and six months later. The primary outcome was PGD symptoms, with additional measures including anxiety, depression, coping strategies, attachment style, psychological flexibility, post-traumatic growth, social support, and therapeutic alliance. The final analyses indicate equivalence between Empower-Grief and TAU, suggesting that both interventions yielded comparable outcomes in reducing PGD symptoms and associated psychological distress. The initial symptoms and therapeutic alliance were predictors of the results in both post- and follow-up moments. This study contributes to the evidence on grief interventions in palliative care, highlighting the importance of structured support for bereaved caregivers. While Empower-Grief demonstrated comparable effectiveness to TAU, its lower intensity, ease of training, and application make it a promising treatment option.",40723756,Social Anxiety Disorder
Differential Effects of Hazardous Drinking on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Outcomes Across Two Prolonged Exposure Treatment Formats.,"Straud Casey L, Buccellato Kiara H, Foa Edna B, Brown Lily A, McLean Carmen P et al.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at increased risk for hazardous drinking, which often complicates treatment and affects trauma-focused psychotherapy outcomes. The present study is an exploratory, secondary analysis investigating differential effects of prolonged exposure (PE) among those with and without hazardous drinking and whether treatment outcomes varied across these groups as a function of PE format. Data used were from a randomized controlled trial that examined two daily, compressed formats of PE treatment for PTSD (massed and intensive outpatient program) in military personnel and veterans (N = 234). Individuals without hazardous drinking had greater PTSD symptom reductions compared to those with hazardous drinking (d = 0.42, p = 0.001). However, the hazardous drinking group also demonstrated significant reductions in PTSD (d = 1.46, p < 0.001) following treatment, as well as in the number of drinks per week (d = 0.63, p = 0.025) at the 6-month follow-up. There was no significant difference in treatment engagement based on drinking classification and outcomes did not vary based on PE format. The findings suggest that PE is an appropriate treatment for individuals with PTSD and hazardous drinking. However, group differences in PTSD symptom reductions indicate concurrent hazardous drinking reduces treatment benefits of PE.",40723738,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Impact of Socio-Demographic Factors, Financial Burden, and Social Support on Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Puerto Rican Women with Breast Cancer.","Ayala-Rodríguez Paulette, Rivera-Alers Dayaneira, Rivera-Vélez Manuel, Díaz-Rodríguez Jovanny, Ramirez-Ruiz Mercedes et al.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cancer diagnosis among women in Puerto Rico. Psychological distress is prevalent in this population, and social determinants may exacerbate this risk. This study examines whether sociodemographic characteristics, financial burden, and social support levels are associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression in Puerto Rican women with BC. A quantitative secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of 208 Hispanic women with BC, utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. These scores were compared with sociodemographic values and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-12) scores, establishing statistical significance through association, parametric, and non-parametric tests, and regression models. 38.5% and 26.4% of participants showed clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Age and perceived income showed significant associations with psychological outcomes. However, regression analysis revealed perceived income as the only significant predictor for both depression and anxiety. Tangible and belonging support were significantly lower in participants with symptoms of depression, while appraisal support was significantly lower in participants with symptoms of anxiety. Findings highlight the influence of perceived financial stress on mental health and the need for psychosocial interventions tailored to the patients' economic context.",40723699,Social Anxiety Disorder

Diagnostics and Group Therapy in Patients with Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness and Anxiety Disorder: Biomarkers and Neurofunctional Correlates of Underlying Treatment Effects.,"Maywald Maximilian, Pogarell Oliver, Chrobok Agnieszka, Levai Susanne, Keeser Daniel et al.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland) (2025)","Background: There is a certain degree of overlap between persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) (ICD-11) and anxiety disorders (ANX) with regard to the phenomenological, pathological and neurobiological characteristics of both conditions. The implementation of an integrative psychotherapy programme may potentially result in the generation of synergistic effects across both patient groups. Objectives: This study assessed (1) whether psychological mechanisms similarly influence symptom severity in PPPD and ANX group, (2) the effectiveness of psychotherapy, and (3) potential neurofunctional biomarkers. Methods: Patients with PPPD (n = 14) and ANX (n = 20) underwent an integrative psychotherapy programme with balance training and mindfulness-based interventions. Emotional and neutral pictures were presented during MRI scans before and after therapy, with healthy controls (HC = 29) for comparison. Clinical and psychological questionnaires were administered, and brain activity was analysed in key regions. Results: The only diagnostic difference in the direct comparison between patients with PPPD and with ANX were the vertigo intensity values before and after therapy. PPPD with comorbid anxiety disorder had significantly more fear of physical symptoms than patients without comorbid anxiety disorder. PPPD showed no change regarding vertigo intensity (VSS), anxiety, or depression scores, but reported decreased impact of vertigo on social functioning (VHQ), and improved personal control after therapy (IPQ). By contrast, anxiety, dizziness, depression, alexithymia, and IPQ scores were significantly reduced after therapy in the ANX group. Neuroimaging revealed decreased activity in the hippocampus and superior temporal gyri (STG) in the PPPD group post-therapy as compared to the pre-therapy measurement, while the ANX group showed reduced activity in the insula, thalamus, hippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Compared to the ANX and HC groups, patients with PPPD showed increased activity in the supramarginal gyrus and STG, both of which could serve as biomarkers for PPPD patients but need to be further validated. Conclusions: Anxiety and vertigo may reinforce each other in PPPD, as symptoms persisted post-therapy, whereas ANX patients improved significantly. Nevertheless, there is some evidence for a successful management of symptoms in the PPPD group. Findings are limited by small sample size and require further research.",40722479,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Living with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Beyond the Physical Implications: Cognitive Features, Psychopathology Aspects, and Psychosocial Resources-A Narrative Review.","Tizzoni Federica, Canella Giulia, Delle Fave Antonella, Di Lernia Daniele, Lorusso Maria Luisa et al.",Brain sciences (2025),"Background/Objectives: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is often discussed in the literature with regard to physical impairments. This narrative review aims to show that living with DMD involves psychological, psychosocial, and cognitive aspects in addition to the well-known physical complications. Methods: Firstly, this review examines the main cognitive functions affecting subjects with DMD and the possible role of dystrophin gene mutations on the central nervous system. Secondly, it analyzes the comorbidity between DMD, neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) and psychopathological traits (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms). Finally, the review addresses the relatively sparse literature investigating the positive aspects associated with the experience of DMD, like psychosocial resources, resilience, subjective well-being, positive individual and social functioning, and social support. Results: DMD has a significant impact on cognitive areas, probably due to dystrophin deficiency in the brain. The prevalence of neurodevelopmental comorbidities and psychopathological symptoms is also higher in people with DMD than in the general population. Despite these challenges, emerging studies highlight the role of psychosocial and environmental resources, including resilience and supportive social relations, in promoting a good quality of life and successful adaptation to disease progression. Conclusions: Early recognition of the above difficulties and strengths could ensure better care and promote an overall better quality of life for people with DMD and their families, physically, psychologically, and socially.

Exploration of Psychosocial Issues of Parents in Pediatric Oncology.,"Jose Joel Mathew, Gawali Gautam",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology (2025),"Pediatric cancer not only affects the child but also casts a profound shadow on their families, entangling them in emotional turmoil, financial strain, and disruptions to daily life. Although the psychosocial challenges faced by parents of children with cancer are extensively documented, there is a significant gap in understanding how these needs are addressed. This research aims to bridge this void by delving into the psychosocial issues experienced by these parents. Existing literature highlights the psychological distress, financial hardship, and social isolation that parents endure. Stress, anxiety, depression, guilt, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) emerge as pervasive issues. Parents often grapple with stress stemming from prognosis uncertainty, financial burdens, and the emotional toll of caregiving. Anxiety manifests through constant worry and sleep disturbances, whereas depression brings persistent sadness and appetite changes. Guilt arises from perceived responsibility for the illness, and PTSD symptoms include vivid flashbacks and hypervigilance. These psychosocial issues significantly impact parents' quality of life, leading to sleep disturbances, strained relationships, and compromised self-care. Interventions such as individual and group therapy, along with support groups, play a crucial role in equipping parents with coping skills and stress management strategies. In conclusion, comprehensive support for parents of children with cancer should address emotional distress, practical caregiving, and provide information about the child's diagnosis and treatment. Acknowledging the multifaceted impact of cancer on the family, this research underscores the necessity for tailored interventions to navigate the emotional complexities of parenting and foster resilience amidst adversity.",40719445,Social Anxiety Disorder
The Clinical Applications of Psilocybin Therapies and Post-COVID Syndrome: A Comprehensive Narrative Review.,"Mathew Alfred, Dongre Roshan, Kim Seo Hee, Turner Jack, Mathew Alen et al.",Cureus (2025),"The coronavirus variant (causing the COVID-19 disease) that led to a pandemic sent global shockwaves, resulting in long-term effects on physical, mental, and social well-being and impacting both individuals and communities. With the pandemic's notable impact on mental health, one such potential treatment discussed in recent literature is psilocybin. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring prodrug compound found in select mushrooms shown to reduce clinical symptoms of certain mental health disorders. In this study, we review the status and usage of psilocybin in clinical practice preceding and following the COVID-19 pandemic. The search criteria for the study included psilocybin or psychedelics or psychedelic-therapy psychiatry and long-haul COVID. The search spanned English articles from January 2020 to April 2024, utilizing the PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and PubMed databases. Two reviewers independently screened each record to decide if a study met the inclusion criteria and to account for bias. Each article researched different pathologies, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and COVID-19. The manuscripts collectively emphasize that there is evidence that psilocybin has a role in the treatment of said pathologies, with relatively safe outcomes if administered under proper medical supervision. Psilocybin use was followed up for a relatively long period after some trials, but further research is warranted to draw a more definitive conclusion regarding the therapeutic uses of psilocybin. Our review reflects that barriers to using psilocybin therapeutically for long-haul COVID-19 exist, which significantly impacts the scope of our research. While evidence suggests its efficacy in mental health conditions such as depression and mood disorders, more robust clinical trials are needed. Current literature supports the pharmacological basis that psilocybin may be effective in treating COVID-19 sequelae. Psilocybin's role in inhibiting SARS-Cov-2 protease shows promise, but ultimately, in vitro validation will be necessary before wider approval of the drug. Lastly, large clinical trials comparing psilocybin to standard care and assessing symptom relief in long-term COVID patients may help validate the findings seen in much of the current literature.",40718283,Social Anxiety Disorder

Notwithstanding, the prevalence of mental health disorders among African refugees signals an urgent need to address them. We reviewed mental health interventions tailored to African refugees in North America, identified existing gaps, and suggested mental health services improvement recommendations. Using PRISMA guidelines, we identified (n = 1,164), screened (n = 989), assessed (n = 79), and included (n = 7) peer-reviewed articles detailing interventions that addressed mental health and its associated concerns among African refugees in North America. Our results showed that pre-migration perils and acculturation stressors exacerbated mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, dysphoria, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Interventions that culturally adapted cognitive behavior therapy, peer support, and psycho-education effectively reduced mental health symptoms and improved life satisfaction.

"Associations between parental alcoholism and delinquent behaviours among youth: exploring serial and parallel mediation by posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, anxiety symptoms and impulsivity.","Isingizwe Belise Blandine, Niyonsenga Japhet, Kanazayire Clementine, Nduwamungu Naasson, Ntete Jeanne Marie et al.",European journal of psychotraumatology (2025),"Background: Despite mounting evidence linking parental alcoholism (PA) with delinquency in youth, little is known about the factors that mediate this link globally. This study, therefore, aimed to explore whether Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms and impulsivity serially or parallel mediate the associations between PA and delinquency among youth.Method: A random sample of 341 male participants aged between 17 and 25 years (M = 21.34, SD = 2.23) was selected from the Iwawa Rehabilitation Centre for youth affected by delinquency, alcohol or substance abuse, or homelessness in Rwanda. Data were collected from February to May 2022, using standardized measures of PA, PTSD symptoms, GAD symptoms, impulsivity and delinquency. Mediation models were analysed using the Macro Process in SPSS to examine the simple (single mediator), serial, and parallel mediating models.Results: The results showed high prevalence of parental alcoholism (69.5%), possible PTSD (45.2%), GAD (42%), and impulsivity (Mean = 9.12, SD = 4.07). Analyses revealed significant associations between PA, delinquency, and the mediators. PTSD symptoms, GAD, and impulsivity individually and parallelly mediated the relationship between PA and delinquency, with impulsivity emerging as the strongest mediator, accounting for 21.3% of the total effect and 6.2% of the overall indirect effect. Among the tested models, serial mediation models highlighted a compelling cascading pathway where PA is associated with impulsivity, followed by increased PTSD symptoms, which are then linked to heightened anxiety symptoms and delinquency (PA → impulsivity → PTSD → GAD → delinquency).Conclusion: While the study uses linear statistical models, the results challenge traditional assumptions that traumatic stress necessarily initiates the cascade of risk by suggesting alternative sequences, such as impulsivity playing an earlier or initiating role. These findings support the need for culturally sensitive and trauma-informed interventions that specifically address impulsivity in youth affected by parental alcoholism.",40717640,Social Anxiety Disorder
Savoring meditation for emotional disorders: Targeting positive emotion regulation deficits.,"Kishimoto Tomoko, Hao Ximing, Qian Jianwei",Journal of anxiety disorders (2025),"Deficits in positive emotion regulation (PER) contribute to emotional disorders but are less studied than negative emotion regulation (NER). One maladaptive PER strategy, positive emotion contrast-seeking (PEC-seeking), involves sustaining negative affect to enhance later positive emotions, reinforcing anxiety and depression. This study developed and tested a savoring-based, transdiagnostic intervention to reduce PEC-seeking and alleviate emotional disorder symptoms. A single-blind RCT with 59 Chinese college students with elevated depression and anxiety (majority meeting depression criteria) compared a two-week group savoring meditation intervention to waitlist control. Changes in depression, anxiety, savoring beliefs, and PEC-seeking were assessed at Baseline (T0), MidTest (T1), PostTest (T2), and one-month Follow-up (T3). The experimental group also reported positive and negative affect before and after each group session and individual practice. Savoring meditation significantly reduced depression (T1, d = -1.11, p = .005; T2, d = -1.60, p < .001) with effects maintained at follow-up (T3, p < .001). Negative affect also declined significantly (Session 5, p < .001), though changes in positive affect were not statistically significant. The intervention increased savoring beliefs (T1, d = 1.42, T2, d = 1.41, ps =.003) and reduced PEC-seeking (T1, d = -0.92, p = .027), which in turn mediated reductions in depression. Although anxiety symptoms declined within the experimental group over time, between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, the effect size was larger for the experimental group (T2, d = 0.34) than for the waitlist group (d = 0.01), suggesting a potential anxiolytic effect of the intervention. These findings suggest that targeting maladaptive PER strategies, especially PEC-seeking, via savoring meditation may effectively reduce emotional disorder symptoms. This study highlights PER's role in transdiagnostic interventions and provides novel insights into PER-focused therapies.",40714519,Social Anxiety Disorder
"Sex-dependent role of Neuropeptide-S on anxiety, fear conditioning, and alcohol seeking in alcohol preferring rats.","Li Min, De Carlo Sara, Soverchia Laura, Runyon Scott P, Clark Stewart et al.",Neuropharmacology (2025),"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a global health concern, with stress playing a crucial role in its development and persistence. Currently, no pharmacotherapies specifically targeting stress are approved for AUD treatment. Neuropeptide S (NPS) plays a dual role in stress regulation, exhibiting both anxiolytic and stress-enhancing effects. While NPS reduces alcohol self-administration (ASA) in alcohol preferring rats, its role in AUD-related stress and anxiety remains unclear. This study investigated the behavioral effects of NPS in male and female Marchigian Sardinian alcohol-preferring (msP) rats. To assess its impact on locomotion, anxiety, and fear memory, we conducted an open-field, an elevated plus maze (EPM), and a fear conditioning (FC) paradigm following intracerebroventricular administration of NPS. Furthermore, we examined the effects of NPS on ASA and yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in msP rats. Our results indicate that NPS administration increased locomotor activity in both sexes and selectively alleviated generalized anxiety levels in male rats in the EPM test. In the FC task, administration of NPS immediately after FC test facilitated the extinction of fear memories in females but not in males. Notably, NPS reduced ASA in both female and male rats but did not alter yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking. In conclusion, NPS modulates anxiety in a sex-dependent manner. Since both alcohol and NPS alleviate anxiety and fear conditioning in msP rats, NPS may reduce alcohol intake by replacing the anxiolytic properties of alcohol. These effects appear to be sex-dependent, with NPS primarily alleviating generalized anxiety in males and facilitating fear extinction in females.",40712753,Social Anxiety Disorder
Structural covariance of early visual cortex is negatively associated with PTSD symptoms: A Mega-Analysis from the ENIGMA PTSD workgroup.,"Harnett Nathaniel G, Joshi Soumyaa, Kumar Poornima, Russell Courtney, Dillon Daniel G et al.",Biological psychiatry. Cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging (2025),"Identifying robust neural signatures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms is important to facilitate precision psychiatry and help in understanding and treatment of the disorder. Emergent research suggests structural covariance of early visual regions is associated with later PTSD development. However, large-scale analyses are needed - in heterogeneous samples of trauma-exposed and trauma naive individuals - to determine if such a neural signature is a robust marker of vulnerability.",40712699,Social Anxiety Disorder
The role of the body in altered facial emotion perception in autism and social anxiety.,"Folz Julia, Nikić Kristina, Nikolić Milica, Janowicz Vivien, Koelkebeck Katja et al.",Behaviour research and therapy (2025),"Alterations in the perception of facial emotional expression and their physiological resonance, as well as in accurately sensing bodily states (i.e., interoception) have been reported in both autism and social anxiety. In the current study, we aimed to examine the association between physiological responses, their sensation, and facial emotion perception in individuals on the autism spectrum (N = 40), individuals with social anxiety (N = 27) and neurotypical controls (N = 40). Participants first viewed videos of spontaneous facial expressions (anger, happiness, sadness, fear and neutral) while facial muscle responses (corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major), indicating facial mimicry, and skin conductance, indicating emotional arousal, were recorded. In a separate task, the same expressions were judged regarding their emotion category, the confidence in the accuracy of this judgment, and the intensity of the observed emotional experience. Compared to controls, individuals with social anxiety showed a stronger link between physiological arousal and the perceived intensity of sadness. Individuals on the autism spectrum showed a relatively weaker link between the mimicry of anger and the intensity at which this expression was perceived. Differences in self-reported interoceptive accuracy also played a role in the latter link, suggesting alterations in integrating embodied emotions in autism.",40712257,Social Anxiety Disorder
Changes in social and human-animal interactions in people with epilepsy during dog-assisted interventions.,"Grandgeorge Marine, Renaud Ilona, Vieira Katy Santos, Chalendard Mathilde, Lafond Rachel et al.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B (2025),"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with physical, psychological, and social consequences that can be alleviated by the integration of a service dog in their daily life. Reports showed that various populations benefit from animal-assisted interventions, particularly dog-assisted interventions (DAI). However, to our knowledge, no study has yet examined the effects of DAI on individuals with epilepsy. This study aimed to characterize the interactions of individuals with epilepsy during DAI sessions. Ten adults with epilepsy (five women and five men; mean age: 24.4 ± 3.0 years) participated in three separate groups, each receiving 10 one-hour DAI sessions. Participants' behaviours were assessed using ethological methods (i.e., scan and focal sampling) and data concerning their quality of life and anxiety were collected before and after the interventions, using standardized scales. Our results showed that vocalizations were primarily used in human-to-human exchanges, whereas physical contacts and visual behaviours were more prevalent in human-dog interactions. The therapy dog consistently attracted participants' attention and was a focal point for physical contact. Over the course of the sessions, interactions with other humans increased, while initial interactions with a therapy dog were strong and remained consistent throughout the interventions. This suggests that a dog may serve as a social catalyst, facilitating affiliative relationships among participants. These findings back DAI as a promising non-pharmacological approach to enhance social engagements of individuals with epilepsy. Further research is needed to explore its long-term benefits on social relationships and individuals' well-being, as well as its underlying mechanisms.",40712207,Social Anxiety Disorder
Psychiatric Comorbidities Associated with Food Addiction in Post-Bariatric Patients: Toward Personalized Mental Health Screening and Postoperative Care.,"Florio Ligia, Pozzolo Pedro Maria Olivia, Leopoldo Kae, Pedrosa Maria Amalia Accari, Castaldelli-Maia João Mauricio",Journal of personalized medicine (2025),"Background: Food addiction (FA) is an emerging construct that mirrors the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of substance use disorders. Despite growing interest, its association with specific psychiatric disorders among bariatric patients remains understudied. Objective: Our aim was to examine the prevalence and strength of associations between FA and seven major psychiatric disorders in individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. Methods: In a sample of 100 post-bariatric patients referred for psychiatric evaluation, FA was assessed using the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0), and psychiatric disorders were diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the association between FA and each psychiatric disorder, controlling for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), employment status, the number of children, clinical comorbidities, physical activity, family psychiatric history, and region of residence. Results: FA was present in 51% of the sample. Descriptive analyses revealed a significantly higher prevalence of major depressive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa among individuals with FA. Multivariate models showed robust associations between FA and bulimia nervosa (aOR = 19.42, p < 0.05), generalized anxiety disorder (aOR = 2.88, p < 0.05), obsessive-compulsive disorder (aOR = 6.64, p < 0.05), agoraphobia (aOR = 3.14, p < 0.05), social anxiety disorder (aOR = 4.28, p < 0.05) and major depressive disorder (aOR = 2.79, p < 0.05). Conclusions: FA is strongly associated with a range of psychiatric comorbidities in post-bariatric patients, reinforcing the need for comprehensive mental health screening in this population. These findings underscore the potential role of FA as a clinical marker for stratified risk assessment, supporting more personalized approaches to mental health monitoring and intervention following bariatric surgery.",40710430,Social Anxiety Disorder
"The Association Between COVID-19-Related Persistent Symptoms, Psychological Flexibility, and General Mental Health Among People With and Without Persistent Pain in the UK.","Yu Lin, McCracken Lance M",Clinics and practice (2025),"Objectives: Persistent symptoms following COVID-19 may adversely impact the general mental health of people with chronic pain, and psychological flexibility may buffer these impacts. However, it remains unclear whether such lasting implications of COVID-19 differ between people with and without chronic pain. This study investigated the relationships between persistent symptoms post-COVID-19, psychological flexibility, and general mental health among people with and without persistent pain during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods: A total of 204 adults living in the UK were recruited via social media and completed an online survey, including measures of persistent symptoms, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), insomnia (the Insomnia Severity Index), and psychological flexibility (the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory), and were included in the analyses. Results: Participants with persistent pain (n = 70) experienced more-persistent symptoms, poorer general mental health, and a higher level of psychological inflexibility compared with participants without persistent pain (n = 133). Overall, the relationships between persistent physical symptoms, general mental health, and psychological (in)flexibility showed similar patterns in the two groups. Participants with more-persistent physical symptoms experienced significantly poorer general mental health. Furthermore, people with higher levels of psychological inflexibility reported worse general mental health. There was little evidence that psychological (in)flexibility could ""buffer"" the association between persistent physical symptoms and general mental health. Conclusions: People with chronic pain appear more vulnerable to persistent symptoms and reduced general mental health compared with people without pain. Treatments that reduce psychological inflexibility, such as ACT, may improve outcomes for people with persistent symptoms post-COVID-19.",40710029,Social Anxiety Disorder

Sex differences in the prevalence of common comorbidities in autism: a narrative review.,"Hong Yoo Hwa, Song Da-Yea, Yoo Heejeong",Ewha medical journal (2025),"Autism spectrum disorder involves challenges in social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors. Historically, males have received autism diagnoses at comparatively high rates, prompting an underrepresentation of females in research and an incomplete understanding of sex-specific symptom presentations and comorbidities. This review examines sex differences in the prevalence of common comorbidities of autism to inform tailored clinical practices. These conditions include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, conduct disorder, depression, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and tic disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is prevalent in both sexes; however, females may more frequently exhibit the inattentive subtype. Anxiety disorders display inconsistent sex differences, while conduct disorder more frequently impacts males. Depression becomes more common with age; some studies indicate more pronounced symptoms in adolescent girls, while others suggest greater severity in males. Epilepsy is more prevalent in females, especially those with intellectual disabilities. Despite displaying a male predominance, intellectual disability may exacerbate the severity of autism to a greater degree in females. No clear sex differences have been found regarding tic disorders. Overall, contributors to sex-based differences include biases stemming from male-centric diagnostic tools, compensatory behaviors like camouflaging in females, genetic and neurobiological differences, and the developmental trajectories of comorbidities. Recognizing these factors is crucial for developing sensitive diagnostics and sex-specific interventions. Inconsistencies in the literature highlight the need for longitudinal studies with large, diverse samples to investigate autism comorbidities across the lifespan. Understanding sex differences could facilitate earlier identification, improved care, and personalized interventions, thus enhancing quality of life for individuals with autism.",40704198,Social Anxiety Disorder
Disentangling the association between cognitive flexibility and anxiety in autistic youth: real-world flexibility versus performance-based task switching.,"Mahmud Farah, Kang Erin, McDonald Rachel G, Wallace Drew, Masia Warner Carrie",Frontiers in psychiatry (2025),"Anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent among autistic youth yet remain under-recognized and undertreated, in part, due to a limited conceptual understanding of autistic cognition. Emerging evidence suggests that autistic differences in cognitive flexibility (CF) may be associated with a greater likelihood of developing and maintaining anxiety symptoms, relative to non-autistic youth. However, further work is needed to elucidate mechanisms of anxiety vulnerability that could inform potential targets for anxiety treatment in autistic youth. The current study aims to examine the associations between CF and anxiety in this population. Given the complexity of CF as a multifaceted construct, we used a multi-method approach to measure CF in order to tease apart its relationship with anxiety symptoms. Specifically, we hypothesized that real-world flexibility difficulties (assessed by survey measures), and poorer task switching performance (assessed by neurocognitive lab measures), would be associated with higher anxiety.",40704036,Social Anxiety Disorder
