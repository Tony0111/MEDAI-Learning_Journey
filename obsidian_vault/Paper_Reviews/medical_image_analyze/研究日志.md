> Background: Echocardiography is a cornerstone in the clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, providing critical insights into cardiac structure and function. Over recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative adjunct to traditional echocardiographic techniques, enhancing diagnostic accuracy through innovations such as automatic view labeling, advanced image segmentation, and predictive disease modeling. The objective of this study is to explore the current status and prevailing research trends in this field from 2009 to 2024 through bibliometric analysis and to forecast future developmental trajectories.

#### 引言第一段

> [!quote] 
> Echocardiography is one of the most important tools for assessing the structure and function of the heart, providing important information on ventricular wall motion, valve status, chamber size and hemodynamics. Consequently, it plays an indispensable role in the diagnosis and treatment of most cardiovascular diseases (1). The incidence of cardiovascular diseases has gradually increased with the improvement of living standards, and as a result, new techniques of echocardiography have been updated, such as three-dimensional echocardiography, speckle tracking, and semiautomated analysis. However, compared with other modalities, echocardiography is often affected by inter-observer variability and is strongly dependent on the level of experience (1). The limitations of echocardiography are evidently more prominent in the increasing demand and complexity, these include multiple measurements increasing the complexity of duration and subjectivity of the user, complex analyses during assessment, and high standards for personalized assessment (2). It is imperative to find ways to reduce inter-examiner variability in echocardiography to improve efficiency and reduce acquisition time.

#### 引言第二段

> With the rapid advancement of information and medical technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major focus in the medical field, particularly in echocardiography, where it addresses inconsistencies and inter-and intra-observer variability in image acquisition and measurement processes (3). In fact, the integration of echocardiography and AI is not an entirely new topic. An earlier example of the application of echocardiography in conjunction with machine learning dates back to 1978, when Fourier analysis was used in M-mode ultrasound to assess the waveform of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Studies have confirmed the significant impact of this method on the adjunctive diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse (4). In some cases, deep learning models now outperform humans in image recognition and have been used to develop fully automated echocardiography interpretation programs, including view recognition, image segmentation, quantification of structure and function, and disease detection (5). In recent years, AI applications in echocardiography have gained significant attention, although challenges remain, such as insufficient standardization, poor robustness, and limited generalization of models in clinical applications (6). Bibliometrics is a well-known effective method for studying influential authors, journals, or countries/ regions, building collaborative networks, and identifying research hotspots in specific fields (7, 8). This study aims to explore the current research status and trends from 2009 to 2024 through bibliometric analysis and to predict future developments in this field

> Annual publications analysis（年度出版物分析）
> As depicted in Figure 1A, between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2024, 3,411 publications on application of AI in echocardiography were included. There were a total of 3,000 articles (87.9%) and 411 reviews (12.1%) from 20,331 scholars in 100 countries/regions published in 1,014 journals. As shown in Figure 1B, the number of publications on Application of AI in echocardiography has increased exponentially in the last 5 years, with a significant correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9635) between the two variables. The number of publications has been consistently low flat until 2018. The publication volume reached its peak in 2024 (745, 21.8%). According to the current trend, it is hypothesized that this field will be a hotspot of interest in the future.

> Keywords are words or phrases carefully selected by authors to help readers and retrieval systems quickly understand the subject of an article and they play an important role in hot topics and trends. In the study according to the keyword co-occurrence analysis in VOSviewer 11,933 keywords were collected and we list the top 10 keywords in Table 6. The top three most frequently occurring keywords were “Deep Learning” (657 occurrences) “Machine Learning” (639 occurrences) and “Artificial Intelligence” (627 occurrences). respectively which were consistent with our research theme. The other keywords for related topics include “Echocardiography,” “Ultrasonography,” “Ultrasound,” “Diagnosis,” “Classification,” “segmentation,” “management.” The keywords with a minimum occurrence of 8 occurrences (n = 587) were visualized by VOSviewer software, as shown in Figure 8A. We also analyzed the visualization of the year overlay (Figure 8B) and the density visualization (Figure 8C). It represents the research trends and focus in the application field of AI in echocardiography. Using CiteSpace to capture burst keywords and construct timeline views to further explore emerging research hotspots associated with AI and echocardiography. As shown in Figure 8D. The blue line segments represent the time intervals and the red line segments indicate the times of frequent references. The keywords “Image segmentation” and “artificial neural networks” are the two keywords that have exploded with the highest burst intensity. They were also revealed to be the key research field for AI in echocardiography applications. In addition, the keywords such as “risk stratification”; “dilated cardiomyopathy”; “object detection” and “predictive models” have become the popular research recently.
