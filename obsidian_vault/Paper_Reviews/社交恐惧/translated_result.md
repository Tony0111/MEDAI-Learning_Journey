| A Novel Hypnotic Intervention for the Treatment of Ornithophobia.

Emma's chronic fear of pigeons had significantly impacted her professional life. The Severity Measure for Specific Phobia-Adult (SMSP-A) was used to assess her level of phobia pre- and post-intervention, as well as at a 6-month follow-up. Emma's hypnotizability was measured using the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale - Form C (SHSS:C). Following a single hypnotic session, Emma experienced accidental physical contact with a pigeon. This incident activated the resourcefulness response elicited during hypnosis, leading to an instant healing of her phobia. This positive outcome not only persisted but showed further improvement at follow-up. Additionally, Emma resumed her university studies and overcame her driving phobia. These findings suggest that the intervention was efficacious in treating Emma's ornithophobia and promoting her overall personal growth. The study provides a comprehensive account of the intervention and discusses its implications for treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 本案例研究探讨了一名25岁女性（化名艾玛）通过整合正念与自主训练的新型催眠疗法成功治愈严重鸟类恐惧症的过程。艾玛对鸽子的长期恐惧严重影响了她的职业生涯。研究采用特定恐惧症严重程度成人量表（SMSP-A）评估干预前、干预后及六个月随访时的恐惧水平，并使用斯坦福催眠感受性量表C表（SHSS:C）测量其催眠易感性。在单次催眠治疗后，艾玛意外与鸽子发生肢体接触，这一事件激活了催眠过程中建立的资源反应机制，使其恐惧症瞬间痊愈。这一积极疗效不仅持续存在，随访时更呈现进一步改善。此外，艾玛重返大学校园并克服了驾驶恐惧。研究结果表明该疗法对治疗鸟类恐惧症及促进个人整体成长具有显著效果，文中详细记录了干预过程并探讨了其临床意义。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 40748612 | specific phobia |

Previously classified as "phobic disorders" and "other anxiety disorders" within the group "neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders", in ICD-11 "anxiety- or fear-related disorders" now constitute a separate group. The core diagnoses of agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are retained, with the modification that agoraphobia and panic disorder can now be diagnosed separately and comorbidly. Within the framework of the lifespan perspective, separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been moved to the group "anxiety- or fear-related disorders". The diagnosis "mixed anxiety and depressive disorder" is now classified as "mixed depressive and anxiety disorder" in the group "affective disorders". In accordance with the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‑5), it is possible to code isolated panic attacks in addition to other mental or somatic disorders. Overall, ICD-11 follows the DSM‑5 classification of anxiety- and fear-related disorders in many respects. Furthermore, the omission of subcategorizations and a precise minimum number of required symptoms simplify the diagnostic criteria. Future studies will need to address questions regarding the diagnostic accuracy, clinical practicability and further operationalization of the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for anxiety- or fear-related disorders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 随着世界卫生组织《国际疾病与相关健康问题统计分类》第11版（ICD-11）的发布，焦虑障碍的诊断指南在结构和内容上进行了调整，本文对此进行了综述。此前被归类为"神经症性、应激相关及躯体形式障碍"中的"恐怖性障碍"和"其他焦虑障碍"，在ICD-11中"焦虑或恐惧相关障碍"已成为独立类别。广场恐怖症、社交焦虑障碍、特定恐怖症、惊恐障碍和广泛性焦虑障碍等核心诊断得以保留，其中广场恐怖症与惊恐障碍现可单独或共病诊断。在生命全程视角框架下，分离焦虑障碍和选择性缄默症被移至"焦虑或恐惧相关障碍"类别。原"混合性焦虑抑郁障碍"现归入"情感障碍"类别并更名为"混合性抑郁焦虑障碍"。与《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》第5版（DSM-5）一致，除其他精神或躯体障碍外，ICD-11新增了孤立性惊恐发作的编码。总体而言，ICD-11在多方面沿袭了DSM-5对焦虑恐惧相关障碍的分类方式。此外，通过取消亚型分类和精简最低症状数量要求，诊断标准得到简化。未来研究需针对ICD-11焦虑恐惧相关障碍诊断标准的准确性、临床适用性及进一步操作化等问题展开探讨。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 40728738 | specific phobia |

However, as a behavioural test is a form of brief exposure, it might not solely measure distress, but also influence it. In this study, we investigated whether measuring spider avoidance behaviour changes spider-related distress. Seventy-five individuals with a broad range of spider fear provided self-reported fear and disgust ratings, using the Spider Distress Scale, before and after engaging in a tarantula and in a house spider behavioural approach task (BAT). We found that self-reported fear, but not disgust, decreased after engaging in the behavioural assessments. A subsequent exploration within low- and high-fear subgroups showed that this pattern was driven by low-fear individuals, as in high-fear individuals spider fear and disgust remained unaffected by the behavioural assessments. Spider fear did not decrease on two exploratory questionnaires. In principle, these findings are promising for the validity of behavioural assessments in translational research where sub-clinical samples are typically targeted. However, they emphasise the need to carefully translate laboratory findings to (sub-)clinical populations, not only due to varying fear levels, but also because behavioural assessments may be experienced differently in the context of a treatment study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 行为评估为焦虑症状提供了临床相关洞察，在监测治疗效果时能对自评问卷形成补充。然而由于行为测试属于短暂暴露形式，它可能不仅测量痛苦感，还会对其产生影响。本研究探讨了测量蜘蛛回避行为是否会改变与蜘蛛相关的痛苦感。75名具有不同程度蜘蛛恐惧的受试者在完成狼蛛和家蛛行为接近任务（BAT）前后，使用蜘蛛痛苦量表自评恐惧与厌恶程度。研究发现参与行为评估后，自报恐惧感（而非厌恶感）有所下降。后续对低恐惧和高恐惧亚组的分析显示，这种模式由低恐惧个体驱动，高恐惧个体的蜘蛛恐惧和厌恶程度未受行为评估影响。两项探索性问卷中蜘蛛恐惧感均未降低。原则上，这些发现对转化研究中针对亚临床样本的行为评估效度具有积极意义，但也强调需谨慎将实验室结果推广到（亚）临床人群——不仅因为恐惧程度存在差异，还因行为评估在治疗研究背景下可能产生不同体验。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 40704338 | specific phobia |

There are only few original research studies on this condition and no study that has meta-analytically synthesized findings to describe the characteristics of persons with emetophobia. To this end, we extracted data from 31 reports and-as we examined different dependent variables-each meta-analysis was based on five to 21 samples. The pooled mean age of persons with emetophobia was 29 years but was reduced to 21-27 years when adjusting for publication bias. The pooled mean age of disorder onset was 10 years. The pooled proportion of females was 91 %. The pooled proportions of reporting fear of vomiting oneself, fear of seeing others vomit, or both, were 47 %, 11 %, and 39 %. The most common comorbid mental disorders were social anxiety disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. The pooled point prevalence of emetophobia was 5 %. Higher emetophobic symptomatology moderately related to higher disgust propensity and higher anxiety, and weakly related to higher depressive symptomatology. This meta-analysis is the first to quantify that most adults with emetophobia are in early adulthood but the disorder started in childhood, almost all are women, the primary locus of fear is vomiting oneself, the most common comorbid mental disorders are other anxiety and affective disorders, and higher emetophobic symptomatology relates to a more general tendency to be easily disgusted and to be anxious. Studies based on representative samples to obtain reliable estimates on the prevalence of emetophobia are needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 呕吐恐惧症特指对呕吐的强烈恐惧。目前针对该病症的原创研究较少，且尚无研究通过荟萃分析综合结果来描述患者特征。为此，我们从31份报告中提取数据，针对不同因变量分别进行了基于5至21个样本的荟萃分析。汇总数据显示，呕吐恐惧症患者的平均年龄为29岁，但校正发表偏倚后降至21-27岁；平均发病年龄为10岁；女性占比高达91%。其中47%的患者仅恐惧自身呕吐，11%仅恐惧目睹他人呕吐，39%同时恐惧两种情况。最常见的共病精神障碍为社交焦虑症、抑郁症和广泛性焦虑症。呕吐恐惧症的时点患病率为5%。症状严重程度与高 disgust propensity（易恶心倾向）和焦虑呈中度相关，与抑郁症状呈弱相关。本项首次量化分析的荟萃研究表明：多数成年患者虽在青壮年期就诊，但病症始于童年期；患者几乎均为女性；主要恐惧对象是自身呕吐；最常见共病为其他焦虑和情感障碍；症状越严重者，越容易产生普遍性恶心倾向和焦虑情绪。未来需基于代表性样本开展研究以获取可靠的患病率数据。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 40700922 | specific phobia |

It is an understudied phobia for which there is no manualized treatment method. The most commonly used technique for treating emetophobia is CBT involving exposure therapy. In this case report, we present a 15-year-old who underwent a variety of treatments used for emetophobia and OCD related to his phobia, and anxiety, beginning at the age of 5 years. Nonetheless, the patient's anxiety intensified significantly during adolescence. He began relying on his parents' reassurance multiple times a day to ensure he was safe. Despite the patient's engagement in traditional forms of exposure-response prevention (ERP) therapy, his symptoms were only greatly decreased following subconscious-facilitated ERP (sERP), defined as a hypnotically facilitated procedure wherein the patient's subconscious directs spontaneous imaginal exposures without conscious initiation. The novel use of hypnosis to facilitate sERP outlined in this paper may function as a workaround in the case of conscious resistance to ERP treatments. More research is needed to define the potential of sERP in the treatment of emetophobia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 呕吐恐惧症（对呕吐的恐惧）是一种持续且严重的特定恐惧症，可能导致日常生活中的显著功能障碍。这是一种研究不足的恐惧症，目前尚无标准化治疗方法。治疗呕吐恐惧症最常用的技术是结合暴露疗法的认知行为疗法（CBT）。本病例报告介绍了一名15岁患者，他从5岁起接受了针对呕吐恐惧症及相关强迫症和焦虑症的各种治疗。然而，患者的焦虑在青春期显著加剧。他开始每天多次依赖父母的安慰来确认自己的安全。尽管患者参与了传统形式的暴露反应预防疗法（ERP），但他的症状只有在接受潜意识辅助ERP（sERP）后才大幅减轻。sERP被定义为一种催眠辅助程序，在此过程中患者的潜意识会自发引导想象暴露，而无需有意识启动。本文提出的这种利用催眠辅助sERP的创新方法，可能为存在意识层面抗拒ERP治疗的患者提供一种解决方案。未来需要更多研究来明确sERP在治疗呕吐恐惧症中的潜力。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 40680060 | specific phobia |

However, despite high efficacy and efficiency, dissemination of exposure-based treatments is limited. Important factors that contribute to this limited dissemination are negative beliefs about exposure on the part of the public, the therapists, and the patients. While patients perceive exposure therapy as burdensome, therapists are concerned about putting too much strain on their patients during exposure, leading to suboptimal delivery of exposure. In a previous study, in which healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, we found initial evidence that the integration of a therapy dog into exposure reduces participants' anxiety and increases participants' positive affect without causing poor treatment outcome. Thus, the integration of a therapy dog into exposure might be a promising approach to address patients' and therapists' concerns and, thus, to (1) foster dissemination of exposure that is (2) delivered in an optimal manner. To scrutinise our findings in a clinical sample, we designed the present study. We test the following hypotheses: (H1) participants in the dog group report significantly less anxiety during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. (H2) Participants in the dog group report significantly more positive affect during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group.

Previously classified as "phobic disorders" and "other anxiety disorders" within the group "neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders", in ICD-11 "anxiety- or fear-related disorders" now constitute a separate group. The core diagnoses of agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are retained, with the modification that agoraphobia and panic disorder can now be diagnosed separately and comorbidly. Within the framework of the lifespan perspective, separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been moved to the group "anxiety- or fear-related disorders". The diagnosis "mixed anxiety and depressive disorder" is now classified as "mixed depressive and anxiety disorder" in the group "affective disorders". In accordance with the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‑5), it is possible to code isolated panic attacks in addition to other mental or somatic disorders. Overall, ICD-11 follows the DSM‑5 classification of anxiety- and fear-related disorders in many respects. Furthermore, the omission of subcategorizations and a precise minimum number of required symptoms simplify the diagnostic criteria. Future studies will need to address questions regarding the diagnostic accuracy, clinical practicability and further operationalization of the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for anxiety- or fear-related disorders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 随着世界卫生组织《国际疾病与相关健康问题统计分类》第11版（ICD-11）的发布，焦虑障碍的诊断指南在结构和内容上进行了调整，本文对此进行了综述。此前被归类为"神经症性、应激相关及躯体形式障碍"中的"恐怖性障碍"和"其他焦虑障碍"，在ICD-11中"焦虑或恐惧相关障碍"已成为独立类别。广场恐怖症、社交焦虑障碍、特定恐怖症、惊恐障碍和广泛性焦虑障碍等核心诊断得以保留，其中广场恐怖症与惊恐障碍现可单独或共病诊断。在生命全程视角框架下，分离性焦虑障碍和选择性缄默症被划入"焦虑或恐惧相关障碍"类别。原"混合性焦虑抑郁障碍"现归入"情感障碍"类别并更名为"混合性抑郁焦虑障碍"。与《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》第5版（DSM-5）一致，除其他精神或躯体障碍外，还可对孤立性惊恐发作进行编码。总体而言，ICD-11在多方面沿袭了DSM-5对焦虑恐惧相关障碍的分类。此外，通过取消亚型分类和精确规定最低症状数量，诊断标准得到简化。未来研究需针对ICD-11焦虑恐惧相关障碍诊断标准的准确性、临床适用性及进一步操作化等问题展开探讨。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 40569310 | specific phobia |

However, it is a relatively unknown and understudied mental disorder. Although it has been speculated that emetophobia might differ from other specific phobias (e.g., in terms of severity), studies on this are virtually non-existent. Thus, this retrospective study analyzed data at admission and discharge from 70 persons with emetophobia and 40 persons with other specific phobias who received a cognitive behavioral therapy-oriented, multimodal inpatient treatment (76.4 % female; mean age 22.7 years, SD = 12.4). Nearly 80 % of persons with emetophobia were female, more than half were adolescents and underweight, and the most common comorbid mental disorders were other anxiety disorders and depression. Compared to inpatients with other specific phobias, persons with emetophobia were younger, had a lower body weight, had higher phobic anxiety, and reported lower life satisfaction at admission. Across both groups, body weight increased with a small effect size and anxiety-related, depressive, and general psychopathology decreased and life satisfaction increased with medium-to-large effect sizes. In conclusion, the current study replicates findings about certain features of persons with emetophobia and is the first study that documents differences between persons with emetophobia and persons with other specific phobias, indicating that emetophobia partially represents a more severe type of specific phobia. Despite these differences, persons with emetophobia and persons with other specific phobias achieve similar and substantial symptom reductions during a multimodal inpatient treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 呕吐恐惧症指对自身或他人可能呕吐的恐惧，在现行诊断手册中被归类为特定恐惧症。然而这是一种相对鲜为人知且研究不足的精神障碍。尽管有推测认为呕吐恐惧症可能与其他特定恐惧症存在差异（例如严重程度方面），但相关研究几乎空白。因此本回顾性研究分析了70名呕吐恐惧症患者与40名其他特定恐惧症患者在入院及出院时的数据，这些患者均接受了以认知行为疗法为导向的多模式住院治疗（女性占76.4%，平均年龄22.7岁±12.4岁）。近80%的呕吐恐惧症患者为女性，超半数为青少年且体重偏轻，最常见的共病精神障碍为其他焦虑症和抑郁症。与其他特定恐惧症住院患者相比，呕吐恐惧症患者年龄更小、体重更低、恐惧性焦虑水平更高，且入院时生活满意度更低。两组患者的体重均出现小幅度增长，焦虑相关症状、抑郁及总体精神病理学症状呈中到大幅度减少，生活满意度呈中到大幅度提升。本研究证实了关于呕吐恐惧症患者某些特征的既有发现，并首次记录了呕吐恐惧症与其他特定恐惧症患者的差异，表明呕吐恐惧症在某种程度上代表更严重的特定恐惧症亚型。尽管存在这些差异，两类患者在多模式住院治疗期间均能实现相似且显著的症状缓解。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 40543409 | specific phobia |

The present preregistered study investigates how context impacts trypophobic reactions through basic situational priming / cognitive appraisal paradigms. Participants were randomly assigned to view trypophobic imagery under one of three conditions: no prompt (control), art gallery exhibition (distraction from trypophobia), or trypophobia-inducing. Results showed that trypophobic reactions depended on rater's level of trypophobia, but also on the situational context. Both high- and low-trypophobic individuals were more comfortable in the trypophobia-inducing context compared to their respective control group. Low-trypophobic individuals found the art gallery condition images the most uncomfortable to view, while high-trypophobic individuals found this condition to be the most comfortable to view. Providing social context or trigger warnings led to less viewing discomfort for those who were strongly-trypophobic. Although age and anxiety levels did not impact the main findings, we found that both play a small role in trypophobic manifestation. Considering age, we argue that older age might be responsible for lower trypophobic tendencies compared to the social learning model of trypophobia. To summarize, these results show that trypophobic reactions can be affected by context, which may help future clinicians and those severely impacted by such imagery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 密集恐惧症是对成簇圆形物体的极端负面反应。这项预先注册的研究通过基础情境启动/认知评估范式，探讨了情境如何影响密集恐惧反应。参与者被随机分配在三种条件下观看密集恐惧图像：无提示（对照组）、美术馆展览（分散对密集恐惧的注意力）或诱发密集恐惧的情境。结果显示，密集恐惧反应既取决于评分者的恐惧程度，也受情境影响。与各自对照组相比，高、低密集恐惧者在诱发情境中都表现出更高的舒适度。低恐惧者认为美术馆条件下的图像最令人不适，而高恐惧者却在该条件下感到最舒适。提供社交情境或触发警告能显著降低高恐惧者的观看不适感。尽管年龄和焦虑水平不影响主要结论，但我们发现两者对恐惧表现有轻微影响。关于年龄因素，我们认为与密集恐惧的社会学习模型相比，年龄增长可能导致恐惧倾向降低。总之，这些结果表明密集恐惧反应会受到情境调节，这一发现或将为临床工作者和受此类图像严重影响者提供帮助。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 40527132 | specific phobia |

However, only 50 % of patients demonstrate significant benefits from these approaches. Therefore, investigating strategies to improve treatment effectiveness or develop novel therapeutic approaches remains an important research objective. Current therapeutic modalities may leave the original fear memory intact, potentially leading to symptom recurrence over time. In contrast, the disruption of reconsolidation processes can facilitate permanent modifications to fear memory, resulting in a reduced risk of relapse after psychotherapy. Recent laboratory studies have shown that the reconsolidation of experimentally induced fear can be effectively disrupted by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and significantly prevents the return of fear. In this study, we translated these results to participants with elevated fear of spiders. 34 participants with spider fear were randomly assigned to a verum or a placebo intervention using continuous theta-burst stimulation (80 % of resting motor threshold) applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ten minutes after the reactivation (3 min confrontation with a living tarantula) of the spider fear memory. The ANOVA for the primary outcome (Spider Phobia Questionnaire, SPQ) resulted in a significant effect of time, but no significant interaction of time and treatment group. Notably, exploratory analyses revealed a significant correlation between stimulation intensity in the verum group and the reduction in spider fear. This association suggest that rTMS-induced disruptions of reconsolidation may serve as a viable therapeutic option for anxiety disorders; however, further research is needed to delineate the optimal parameters for such interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 焦虑障碍可通过认知行为疗法和精神药理学干预得到有效治疗。然而，仅50%的患者能从这些方法中显著获益。因此，探索提升治疗效果或开发新型治疗策略仍是重要研究目标。现有治疗模式可能无法消除原始恐惧记忆，导致症状随时间推移复发。相比之下，破坏记忆再巩固过程可实现恐惧记忆的永久性修正，从而降低心理治疗后复发的风险。近期实验室研究表明，重复经颅磁刺激（rTMS）能有效破坏实验诱导恐惧的再巩固，显著防止恐惧感重现。本研究将这些发现应用于蜘蛛恐惧症受试者：34名参与者被随机分配至真实刺激组或安慰剂组，在蜘蛛恐惧记忆激活（与活狼蛛接触3分钟）10分钟后，接受右侧背外侧前额叶皮层的连续θ脉冲刺激（静息运动阈值的80%）。主要结局指标（蜘蛛恐惧问卷SPQ）的方差分析显示时间效应显著，但时间与治疗组间无显著交互作用。值得注意的是，探索性分析显示真实刺激组的刺激强度与蜘蛛恐惧程度降低呈显著相关。这一关联提示rTMS诱导的记忆再巩固破坏可能成为焦虑障碍的可行治疗方案，但需进一步研究明确最佳干预参数。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 40383201 | specific phobia |

Less is known about the stability and change of mental disorders and whether individual or contextual factors that are protective of adult mental disorders could be identified. The current study is a 10-year follow-up of young adults with a history of RYC in Norway. At baseline (T1), 76% met criteria of a mental disorder. At follow-up (T2), diagnostic psychiatric interviews were conducted by phone by experienced doctors and psychologists. A response rate of 52% was achieved (n = 157). Criteria for at least one present mental disorder were fulfilled by 77.6%. The most prevalent single disorders were PTSD (42.1%), agoraphobia (33.3%), social phobia (27.9%), major depressive episode (23.1%), specific phobia (21.1%), and ADHD (19.2%). Most participants had more than one mental disorder. Among those with a diagnosis at T1, completing high school was the only factor found to be associated with no diagnosis at T2 (p = 0.019), whereas no statistically significant association was found with sex, age at first placement and received aftercare. We found a very high prevalence of mental disorders and a high rate of comorbidity comparable to the prevalence at baseline. This shows high stability of psychopathology from adolescence into adulthood. Ensuring access to high quality mental health services for young adults with a history of living in RYC is important. Prevention and early intervention, such as aid to complete education, should be prioritized for young people with high risk of developing mental disorders. Response rate, sample size and selection bias are discussed as possible limitations to the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 在寄养青少年（RYC）中，经历逆境的比例较高，心理障碍的患病率也很高。关于心理障碍的稳定性与变化，以及能否识别出对成人心理障碍具有保护作用的个体或环境因素，目前所知较少。本研究对挪威有RYC经历的年轻人进行了为期10年的跟踪调查。基线（T1）时，76%的受访者符合心理障碍诊断标准。随访（T2）阶段，由经验丰富的医生和心理学家通过电话进行精神诊断访谈，应答率为52%（n=157）。77.6%的受访者当前至少符合一种心理障碍诊断标准，最常见的是创伤后应激障碍（42.1%）、广场恐惧症（33.3%）、社交恐惧症（27.9%）、重度抑郁发作（23.1%）、特定恐惧症（21.1%）和注意力缺陷多动障碍（19.2%）。多数参与者患有一种以上心理障碍。在T1时确诊的群体中，完成高中学业是唯一与T2时无诊断显著相关的因素（p=0.019），而性别、首次安置年龄和接受的后续护理则无统计学显著关联。研究发现心理障碍患病率及共病率极高，与基线水平相当，表明从青春期到成年期精神病理学特征具有高度稳定性。确保有RYC经历的年轻人获得优质心理健康服务至关重要。对于心理障碍高风险青少年，应优先采取预防和早期干预措施（如支持完成学业）。研究可能受应答率、样本量和选择偏倚的限制。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 40287873 | specific phobia |

Specifically, we aimed at understanding the role of disorder category, clinical status, family risk, and the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal. To this end, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) of performance monitoring (i.e., error-related negativity, ERN, and correct-response negativity, CRN) in a large sample of 156 participants, including groups of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia, as well as a naturalistic control group. Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not observe significant differences in ERPs among the clinical groups, nor in comparison to the naturalistic control group. However, after creating a more strictly defined healthy control group, we found larger ERN amplitudes in the specific phobia compared with the healthy control group. In addition, when comparing participants with and without a lifetime clinical diagnosis of any internalizing disorder, regardless of their main diagnosis, as well as when comparing those with or without a family risk for internalizing psychopathology, we observed larger amplitudes for both ERN and CRN. Subsequently, we combined data from this study and a previously published subclinical study to examine the role of transdiagnostic symptom dimensions (i.e., anxious apprehension and anxious arousal) across a wider severity spectrum. In this joint sample of 246 participants, gender emerged as a moderator of the link between anxious apprehension and enhanced performance monitoring. Specifically, women with increasing anxious apprehension exhibited elevated ERN and CRN amplitudes. In conclusion, our study challenges the notion of a disorder-specific link to performance monitoring. Instead, our findings suggest that enhanced performance monitoring is associated with a higher propensity for anxious apprehension and acts as a broad risk marker for internalizing psychopathology, reflecting vulnerability beyond diagnostic borders within the anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive spectrum.                                                                                                                                 | 在这项预先注册的研究中，我们探讨了表现监控的神经关联与焦虑及强迫谱系障碍之间的关系。具体而言，我们旨在理解障碍类别、临床状态、家族风险以及焦虑性忧虑和焦虑性觉醒这两个跨诊断症状维度所起的作用。为此，我们在一个包含156名参与者的大样本中测量了表现监控的事件相关电位（ERPs），包括错误相关负波（ERN）和正确反应负波（CRN）。参与者包括强迫症、社交焦虑症和特定恐惧症患者组，以及一个自然对照组。与我们最初的预期相反，我们并未观察到临床组之间或与自然对照组之间的ERPs存在显著差异。然而，在建立一个更严格定义的健康对照组后，我们发现特定恐惧症组的ERN波幅比健康对照组更大。此外，当比较有或没有任何内化障碍终身临床诊断的参与者（无论其主要诊断如何），以及比较有或没有内化精神病理家族风险的参与者时，我们观察到ERN和CRN的波幅均更大。随后，我们结合了本研究数据和之前发表的一项亚临床研究数据，以检验跨诊断症状维度（即焦虑性忧虑和焦虑性觉醒）在更广泛严重程度范围内的作用。在这个包含246名参与者的联合样本中，性别成为焦虑性忧虑与增强的表现监控之间关系的调节因素。具体而言，随着焦虑性忧虑程度的增加，女性表现出更高的ERN和CRN波幅。总之，我们的研究挑战了表现监控与特定障碍相关的观点。相反，我们的研究结果表明，增强的表现监控与更高的焦虑性忧虑倾向相关，并作为内化精神病理学的广泛风险标志物，反映了焦虑和强迫谱系障碍诊断边界之外的易感性。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 40259892 | specific phobia |

However, the prevalence and correlates of avoidant/restrictive eating characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in individuals with SPOV is unknown. We aimed to examine the frequency, correlates, predictors, and detection of ARFID secondary to SPOV in adults. Adults with SPOV recruited on vomit phobia Reddit forums (N = 276) completed measures of (1) eating restrictions associated with ARFID, (2) ARFID symptoms and their perceived causes, and (3) SPOV severity, clinical impairment from eating, depression and anxiety, and candidate predictors of ARFID in a SPOV population. Forty eight percent of participants met full self-reported ARFID criteria and 27.5% met criteria for subthreshold ARFID. Participants with full-ARFID reported significantly higher levels of SPOV, depression, and anxiety, while all ARFID-endorsing participants reported greater clinical impairment from eating and dimensional symptoms of fear- and appetite ARFID than participants with SPOV only. Fear of food was the only candidate predictor independently associated with ARFID status. ARFID symptoms were extremely common among adults with SPOV who seek support in online forums. ARFID symptomatology was associated with greater impairment and comorbidity compared to SPOV alone. Future research is needed to understand if targeting ARFID symptoms in treatment improves outcomes for SPOV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 患有呕吐特定恐惧症（SPOV）的患者常通过避免某些食物或限制进食来防止呕吐。然而，SPOV患者中符合回避性/限制性食物摄入障碍（ARFID）特征的饮食回避/限制行为的流行率及相关因素尚不明确。本研究旨在探讨成人SPOV继发ARFID的发生频率、相关因素、预测因素及其识别情况。通过呕吐恐惧症Reddit论坛招募的276名SPOV成人患者完成了以下评估：(1)与ARFID相关的饮食限制行为，(2)ARFID症状及其感知诱因，(3)SPOV严重程度、饮食行为导致的临床功能损害、抑郁焦虑水平，以及SPOV人群中ARFID的潜在预测因素。结果显示：48%的参与者符合自我报告的完全ARFID标准，27.5%符合阈下ARFID标准。完全ARFID组报告了显著更高的SPOV严重程度、抑郁和焦虑水平；所有ARFID阳性参与者相比单纯SPOV组，均表现出更严重的饮食相关功能损害及更高维度的恐惧型/食欲型ARFID症状。对食物的恐惧是唯一与ARFID状态独立相关的预测因素。结论表明：在寻求网络支持的SPOV成人群体中，ARFID症状极为普遍；相较于单纯SPOV，伴随ARFID症状会带来更严重的功能损害和共病情况。未来需进一步研究针对ARFID症状的治疗是否能改善SPOV预后。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 40256877 | specific phobia |

Neuroimaging (2025)                                              | In this study, we propose a classification method for identifying subtypes of anxiety disorders (AD). A large dataset is built with 108 healthy controls and 179 subjects from four primary AD subtypes: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), and specific phobia (SP). We calculate diverse multimodal data, including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and voxel-based morphometry, and create brain gradient data to provide a comprehensive representation of these data. For subtype classification, we develop a hierarchical binary hypothesis testing (H-BHT) framework with a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, we use a traditional BHT method to identify AD individuals. In the second stage, we categorize AD subjects into different subtypes under multi-class hypotheses. Our experiments demonstrate that the gradient data outperforms single-modal data in subtype classification, achieving an impressive 97.9% accuracy. When performing a multivariate analysis of variance on the brain regions associated with the discriminative gradient data, it reveals significant biomarkers among the subtypes, including the insula, amygdala, orbital inferior frontal, middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyri. These regions are strongly correlated with emotion control, providing substantial support for the pathogenesis of existing AD subtypes and confirming the validity of our method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 本研究提出了一种用于识别焦虑障碍（AD）亚型的分类方法。我们构建了一个包含108名健康对照者和179名来自四种主要AD亚型（广泛性焦虑障碍GAD、社交焦虑障碍SAD、惊恐障碍PD和特定恐惧症SP）受试者的大型数据集。通过计算低频波动振幅、区域同质性和基于体素的形态测量等多模态数据，并构建脑梯度数据以实现对这些数据的综合表征。针对亚型分类，我们开发了采用两阶段策略的分层二元假设检验（H-BHT）框架：第一阶段使用传统BHT方法识别AD个体；第二阶段在多类别假设下将AD受试者划分为不同亚型。实验表明，梯度数据在亚型分类中的表现优于单模态数据，准确率高达97.9%。对判别性梯度数据相关脑区进行多元方差分析时，发现了包括岛叶、杏仁核、眶额下回、额中回和前扣带回在内的显著亚型生物标志物。这些区域与情绪控制密切相关，不仅为现有AD亚型的发病机制提供了有力支持，也验证了我们方法的有效性。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 40245748 | specific phobia |

Comorbidity of psychiatric disorders is considered common in ADHD and has been found to contribute to poorer prognosis. Despite decades of research, the actual prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD is unclear. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the prevalence of comorbid disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. Embase OVID, Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO were systematically searched for eligible studies published up to February 2025. In total 121 studies involving 39,894 children and adolescents with ADHD diagnosis were included. The most common comorbid disorders were Oppositional Defiant Disorder (34.7 %), Behavior Disorders (30.7 %), Anxiety Disorders (18.4 %), Specific phobias (11.0 %), Enuresis (10.8 %), and Conduct Disorder (CD) (10.7 %). All individual disorders studied had a higher prevalence among children and adolescents with ADHD than in the general population. Few gender differences were found; higher prevalence of CD among boys and higher of OCD in girls. The findings indicate that comorbid psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in children and adolescents with ADHD and must be considered in both assessment and treatment of ADHD.

Trait anxiety has been linked to insufficient recruitment of DLPFC mechanisms for attentional control. Despite limited research on individuals with anxiety disorders, our study utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess DLPFC cortical activity and emotional states using the N100 as an indicator of GABA-B-mediated cortical inhibition. Additionally, we aimed to correlate trait anxiety scores with cortical activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 焦虑障碍（包括特定恐惧症、社交恐惧症和广泛性焦虑障碍）的神经病理学机制，传统观点认为源于背外侧前额叶皮层对边缘系统区域抑制功能的减弱。特质性焦虑与背外侧前额叶皮层注意控制机制激活不足存在关联。尽管针对焦虑障碍患者的研究数据有限，本研究通过经颅磁刺激技术，以反映GABA-B介导皮层抑制的N100成分为指标，评估了背外侧前额叶皮层活动与情绪状态的关系，并进一步探究特质性焦虑评分与皮层活动的相关性。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 40226677 | specific phobia |

While theoretical models of adult SAD emphasize the role of attentional biases, little is known about maintaining factors during childhood and adolescence. The objective of our eye-tracking study was to determine whether youth with SAD exhibit a hypervigilance-avoidance pattern of visual attention for faces. To this end, we used a free-viewing paradigm to present angry, happy, and neutral faces, and non-social object stimuli to three groups of adolescents aged 10-15 years: SAD (n = 57), specific phobia (SP; n = 41), and healthy controls (HC; n = 65). A screen-based eye tracker recorded gaze behavior and pupil dilation. Among participants, only older adolescents with SAD exhibited shorter latencies of first fixation to the eye region compared to HC. Contrary to our expectations, there were no differences in duration of first fixation to the eye region among the groups. Instead, compared to HC, older adolescents with SAD showed longer dwell times on the eye region during the first 1000 - 3000 ms of stimulus presentation. No significant differences among the groups were found regarding scanpath length or pupillary reactivity.

However, a translation of this stimulation technique to clinical practice is lacking. We therefore investigated the potential of vagal stimulation to inhibit excessive fear responses and facilitate responding to in-vivo and laboratory exposure in individuals with specific phobia. Spider-phobic participants were subjected to three standardized in-vivo exposures towards a living tarantula, complemented by an exposure in vitro (between exposure in vivo I and II). Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) was applied during in-vitro exposure, presenting pictures of the exposed tarantula, other spiders and neutral tools in the laboratory. Fear was assessed by self-reports and behavioral avoidance (in-vivo exposures), and amygdala-mediated autonomic and behavioral fear components (exposure in vitro). Vagal stimulation facilitated the reduction of behavioral avoidance across repeated in-vivo exposures. During laboratory exposure, taVNS inhibited fear tachycardia and corrugator muscle activity specifically in response to pictures of the previously exposed tarantula - an effect that became stronger with increasing stimulation duration. Psychophysiological indices of noradrenergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala were elevated during taVNS and correlated to subsequent attenuation of behavioral avoidance. Our results suggest, that taVNS exerts stimulus-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of multiple automatic response components of excessive fear, highlighting taVNS as a valuable adjunct to exposure-based treatment. A translational mechanism of action is supported, proposing that taVNS exhibits its effects by noradrenergic activation of fear extinction circuitry, particularly targeting the basolateral amygdala.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 最新实验室研究表明，迷走神经刺激能通过激活去甲肾上腺素能脑系统促进恐惧消退——这是暴露疗法的核心抑制机制。但目前该刺激技术尚未实现临床转化应用。为此，我们研究了迷走神经刺激抑制过度恐惧反应、促进特定恐惧症患者对实地暴露和实验室暴露反应的潜力。蜘蛛恐惧症受试者接受三次标准化活体狼蛛实地暴露治疗（期间穿插一次实验室暴露），在实验室暴露环节采用经皮耳迷走神经刺激（taVNS）技术，同步展示接触过的狼蛛、其他蜘蛛及中性工具的图片。通过自我报告、行为回避（实地暴露）及杏仁核介导的自主神经/行为恐惧成分（实验室暴露）评估恐惧程度。研究发现：迷走神经刺激能促进重复实地暴露中的行为回避减少；实验室暴露期间，taVNS能特异性抑制对已接触狼蛛图片的恐惧性心动过速和皱眉肌活动——该效应随刺激时长增加而增强；基底外侧杏仁核的去甲肾上腺素能传递心理生理指标在taVNS期间升高，并与后续行为回避减弱相关。结果表明：taVNS对过度恐惧的多种自动反应成分具有刺激特异性和剂量依赖性抑制作用，可作为暴露疗法的有效辅助手段。研究支持转化作用机制假说，即taVNS通过恐惧消退神经环路的去甲肾上腺素能激活（特别是靶向基底外侧杏仁核）发挥作用。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 40204704 | specific phobia |

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy, yet the possible neurobiological mechanisms underpinning its effects remain debated. The dual-route model offers a potential explanation by suggesting that CBT increases activation in the brain areas responsible for emotion regulation while decreasing activation in limbic areas. This scoping review examined possible neurobiological mechanisms supporting CBT's efficacy in anxiety disorders by exclusively reviewing studies that utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The included studies published since 2018 focused on adult samples that received CBT for anxiety disorders, with pre- or post-treatment fMRI data. The data extraction followed a standardized process, with key variables, such as the study design, population, and neuroimaging findings, systematically charted. While the dual-route model explains key aspects of CBT's neurobiological effects, the findings suggest the need for expansion to incorporate areas such as the precuneus, particularly in specific phobias and social anxiety disorder. Further research is required to refine this model and explore additional mechanisms underlying CBT's efficacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 焦虑障碍是一种以过度恐惧和焦虑为特征的常见心理健康问题。认知行为疗法（CBT）已被证明具有疗效，但其潜在神经生物学机制仍存在争议。双路径模型提出了一种可能的解释，认为CBT能增强负责情绪调节的脑区激活，同时降低边缘系统区域的激活。本范围综述通过专门分析采用功能磁共振成像（fMRI）的研究，探讨了支持CBT治疗焦虑障碍疗效的潜在神经生物学机制。纳入的研究均发表于2018年后，聚焦接受CBT治疗的成人焦虑障碍患者群体，并包含治疗前后fMRI数据。数据提取遵循标准化流程，对研究设计、人群和神经影像学发现等关键变量进行系统化梳理。虽然双路径模型解释了CBT神经生物学效应的关键方面，但研究结果表明需要将该模型扩展至楔前叶等区域——特别是在特定恐惧症和社交焦虑障碍中。未来研究需进一步完善该模型，并探索CBT疗效的其他作用机制。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 40141837 | specific phobia |

Investigating personality traits through the framework of the five-factor model (FFM) and their relationship to AP may offer valuable insights with potential applications in preventive and therapeutic interventions. Here, we conducted a case-control analysis comparing the "big five" personality dimensions between individuals with AP and frequent fliers (FFs). We specifically selected FFs as controls due to their demonstrated ability to adapt to aviation-related scenarios and regular exposure to flight environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 飞行恐惧症（AP），即对飞行的恐惧，是一种常见的情境性恐惧症，可能深刻影响个人的生活、社交和职业。通过五因素模型（FFM）框架研究人格特质及其与AP的关系，可能为预防和治疗干预提供有价值的见解。在此，我们进行了一项病例对照分析，比较了AP患者与频繁飞行者（FFs）在“大五”人格维度上的差异。我们特意选择FFs作为对照组，因为他们已展现出适应航空相关场景的能力，并经常接触飞行环境。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 40046396 | specific phobia |

Less than 50% of patients with internalising disorders achieve clinically meaningful improvement, with negative consequences for patients and healthcare systems. The research unit (RU) 5187 seeks to improve this situation by an in-depth investigation of the phenomenon of treatment non-response (TNR) to CBT. We aim to identify bio-behavioural signatures associated with TNR, develop predictive models applicable to individual patients and enhance the utility of predictive analytics by collecting a naturalistic cohort with high ecological validity for the outpatient sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 认知行为疗法（CBT）有效——但并非对所有患者效果均等。在患有内化障碍的患者中，仅有不到50%的人实现了具有临床意义的改善，这对患者和医疗体系均造成了负面影响。研究单元（RU）5187旨在通过深入探究对CBT无治疗反应（TNR）现象来改善这一现状。我们的目标是识别与TNR相关的生物行为特征，开发适用于个体患者的预测模型，并通过收集具有高度生态效度的自然主义队列来提升预测分析在门诊领域的实用性。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 40010810 | specific phobia |

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants with contamination- and animal phobia (N = 49) were randomized to active tDCS (1.7 mA, 20 min; n = 27), or sham tDCS (1.7 mA, 30 s; n = 22), followed by a single session of 30 min of IVE. Active tDCS targeted excitation of the left mPFC and inhibition of the right dlPFC. BPM and HRV were acquired during behavioral approach tasks involving brief (30 s) exposure to feared targets at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a 1-month follow-up, as well as during six 5-min. trials of exposure. Active tDCS produced significantly greater reductions in BPM, and marginally greater increases in HRV from pre-treatment to 1-month in an extinction context, compared to sham tDCS. Similarly, active tDCS produced significantly greater reductions in BPM, and increases in HRV during IVE, relative to the sham tDCS group. Findings for the generalization context were non-significant. Consistent with the main outcome findings, tDCS may offer an effective means of enhancing outcomes in exposure therapy, perhaps through top-down modulation of autonomic arousal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 本研究评估了经颅直流电刺激（tDCS）增强的特定恐惧症活体暴露疗法（IVE）能否在接触恐惧对象期间及之后对心率（BPM）和心率变异性（HRV）产生持久改变的预测。通过双盲安慰剂对照试验，49名患有污染恐惧症和动物恐惧症的受试者被随机分配至主动tDCS组（1.7毫安，20分钟；n=27）或假刺激组（1.7毫安，30秒；n=22），随后接受单次30分钟的IVE治疗。主动tDCS以兴奋左侧内侧前额叶皮层（mPFC）和抑制右侧背外侧前额叶皮层（dlPFC）为目标。在治疗前、治疗后及1个月随访时，通过行为接近任务（包括30秒短暂接触恐惧对象）以及六次5分钟暴露试验期间采集BPM和HRV数据。与假刺激相比，主动tDCS在消退情境中从治疗前到1个月随访期间显著降低了BPM，并边缘性提高了HRV。类似地，在IVE过程中，主动tDCS组比假刺激组表现出更显著的BPM降低和HRV升高。泛化情境下的结果未达显著水平。与主要结果一致，tDCS可能通过自上而下调节自主神经唤醒，为增强暴露疗法效果提供有效手段。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 39904156 | specific phobia |

Under this assumption, studies have looked at the predictive value of the extinction learning paradigm for exposure therapy outcomes. However, predicting factors of long-term exposure therapy success have not been established. Participants with a specific phobia (SP) for spiders were included in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive exposure therapy (n = 25, 24 females) or an active control intervention, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR; n = 18, 15 females). Symptom levels were measured with the Fear of Spiders questionnaire (FSQ) at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and at six- (T2) and twelve (T3) months follow-up. At baseline, participants completed a three-day fMRI fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction recall paradigm. Indices of extinction were defined as self-reported threat expectancy and fear, and neural activation during stimulus presentations and threat omission in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, based on prior data. Mixed model analysis revealed that the exposure therapy group had an overall stronger decrease in phobic symptoms over time than the PMR group (β = 10.95, p < .001). However, none of the indices of extinction learning were predictive for FSQ scores after exposure therapy at the longest follow-up measurement (T3). In sum, the current results show the long-term effectiveness of a single session of exposure therapy for reducing a specific fear of spiders but no baseline characteristics were identified that predicted individual differences in exposure therapy success after one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 消退学习被认为是暴露疗法的核心机制。基于这一假设，研究探讨了消退学习范式对暴露疗法效果的预测价值。然而，暴露疗法长期疗效的预测因素尚未明确。本研究采用双盲随机对照试验设计，纳入蜘蛛特定恐惧症（SP）患者，随机分配至暴露疗法组（n=25，女性24人）或主动控制干预组（渐进式肌肉放松训练PMR；n=18，女性15人）。分别在基线（T0）、干预后（T1）、6个月（T2）和12个月（T3）随访时采用蜘蛛恐惧问卷（FSQ）评估症状水平。基线期，受试者完成为期三天的功能性磁共振成像恐惧 conditioning、消退学习及消退回忆范式。基于既往数据，消退指标定义为：刺激呈现和威胁解除期间自我报告的威胁预期与恐惧程度，以及腹内侧前额叶皮层和伏隔核的神经激活。混合模型分析显示，暴露疗法组随时间推移比PMR组表现出更显著的恐惧症状减轻（β=10.95，p<0.001）。但在最长随访时点（T3），所有消退学习指标均未能预测暴露疗法后的FSQ评分。综上，本研究证实单次暴露疗法对减轻蜘蛛特定恐惧具有长期疗效，但未发现能预测一年后个体疗效差异的基线特征。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 39889926 | specific phobia |

Yet, fear often returns after treatment. Occasional reinforcement, in which the feared stimulus is intermittently presented during extinction, increases safety learning and slows fear renewal in conditioning paradigms and analogue samples, but no studies to date have examined this strategy in clinical samples. The present study examined the effects of vicarious occasional reinforcement on fear renewal in a snake-phobic sample across multiple levels of analysis. Fear was intermittently reinforced by providing reminders of the feared outcome (a snake bite) throughout a two-session analogue video exposure manipulation. Snake-phobic adults were randomized to one of three conditions: a single-cue [S], multiple-cue [M], or multiple-cue+fear-outcome [M+FO] exposure group. Results showed the three groups did not significantly differ in threat expectancy or attentional bias for threat at follow-up. Despite sustained anxiety, however, the M+FO condition completed significantly more steps on a visual avoidance task at follow-up than the M and S conditions and heightened mean distress during exposure mediated this effect. The M and S groups did not significantly differ in visual avoidance at follow-up. These findings suggest incorporating reminders of the feared outcome into exposure may be an effective strategy for increasing inhibitory retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 暴露疗法是治疗焦虑相关障碍的有效方法。然而治疗后恐惧常会复发。在消退训练中间歇呈现恐惧刺激的偶发强化法，能增强条件反射范式与模拟样本中的安全学习并延缓恐惧重现，但迄今尚未有研究在临床样本中检验该策略。本研究通过多层面分析，考察了替代性偶发强化对蛇恐惧症样本恐惧重现的影响。在两阶段模拟视频暴露干预中，通过持续提供恐惧结果（被蛇咬伤）的提示来实现恐惧间歇强化。蛇恐惧症成人被随机分配至单线索[S]、多线索[M]或多线索+恐惧结果[M+FO]三个暴露组之一。结果显示三组在随访期的威胁预期与威胁注意偏向上无显著差异。但尽管持续存在焦虑，M+FO组在随访期视觉回避任务中的完成步骤显著多于M组和S组，且暴露期间较高的平均痛苦程度中介了这一效应。M组与S组在随访期视觉回避表现上无显著差异。这些发现表明，在暴露治疗中融入恐惧结果提示可能是增强抑制性提取的有效策略。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 39882772 | specific phobia |

Previous studies have focused on the high place phenomenon (HPP), which is the sudden urge to jump from high places. One aim of this study is to replicate the previously found associations of HPP with suicidality and anxiety in a larger sample of patients suffering from flight phobia or agoraphobia.

Although anxiety has a major influence on the body, evidence-based treatments mainly focus on cognitive and behavioral aspects of anxiety. Body- and movement-oriented interventions, such as psychomotor therapy (PMT), address the physical aspects. Bodily experience and interoceptive awareness are used to change behavior, cognition, and emotions.

Previous studies often faced limitations, such as small sample sizes, focusing on only one neuroimaging modality, and reliance on univariate analyses, which produced inconsistent findings. This study was designed to overcome these issues by using for the first time advanced multivariate machine-learning techniques to identify the neural mechanisms underlying SAP. Specifically, we relied on the multimodal Canonical Correlation Analysis approach combined with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to decompose the structural magnetic resonance images from 122 participants into covarying gray and white matter networks. Stepwise logistic regression and boosted decision trees were then used to extract a predictive model of SAP. Our results indicate that four covarying gray and white matter networks, IC19, IC14, IC21, and IC13, were critical in classifying SAP individuals from control subjects. These networks included brain regions, such as the Middle Temporal Gyrus, Precuneus, Insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex-all known for their roles in emotional regulation, cognitive control, and sensory processing. To test the generalizability of our results, we additionally ran a supervised machine-learning model (boosted decision trees), which achieved an 83.3% classification accuracy, with AUC of 0.9, indicating good predictive power. These findings provide new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of SAP and suggest potential biomarkers for diagnosing and treating this condition. The study offers a more nuanced understanding of SAP, with implications for future research and clinical applications in anxiety disorders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 小动物恐惧症（SAP）是特定恐惧症的一个亚型，表现为对小动物强烈且非理性的恐惧，其在神经科学领域的研究尚不充分。以往研究常受限于样本量小、仅采用单一神经影像模态或依赖单变量分析，导致结果不一致。本研究首次运用先进的多变量机器学习技术，旨在揭示SAP的神经机制。具体而言，我们采用多模态典型相关分析结合独立成分分析（ICA），对122名参与者的结构磁共振图像进行分解，得到共变的灰质和白质网络。随后通过逐步逻辑回归和提升决策树提取SAP的预测模型。结果显示，四个共变的灰质和白质网络（IC19、IC14、IC21和IC13）对区分SAP患者与对照组至关重要，这些网络涉及颞中回、楔前叶、岛叶及前扣带回等脑区——这些区域在情绪调节、认知控制和感觉处理中起关键作用。为验证结果的普适性，我们额外运行了监督机器学习模型（提升决策树），其分类准确率达83.3%，AUC值为0.9，表明模型具有良好的预测能力。这些发现为SAP的神经生物学基础提供了新见解，并提示了潜在的诊断和治疗生物标志物。该研究深化了对SAP的理解，对焦虑障碍的未来研究和临床应用具有启示意义。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 39753800 | specific phobia |

A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to January 30, 2024. The outcomes were depression and anxiety. Subgroup analysis was performed according to outcome population as youth onset, sex and duration of medication. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were also performed. Thirty-three studies were included. The children and adolescents with ADHD had a significantly higher risk of depressive disorder than those without ADHD [pooled relative risk (RR) = 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.57-3.29, P < 0.001]. The children and adolescents with ADHD were at a higher risk of major depressive disorder than those without ADHD (pooled RR = 2.20, 95%CI = 1.47-3.29, P = 0.002). The children and adolescents with ADHD had an increased risk of specific phobia versus those without ADHD (pooled RR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.16-2.44, P = 0.006). The risk of social phobia in the ADHD group was higher than that in the non-ADHD group (pooled RR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.13-2.61, P = 0.012). The children and adolescents with ADHD were at an elevated risk of agoraphobia compared with those without ADHD (pooled RR = 4.99, 95%CI = 1.51-16.56, P = 0.009). Children and adolescents with stimulant medications had a significantly lower risk of depression than those without stimulant medications (pooled RR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.72-0.89, P < 0.001). In conclusion, children and adolescents with ADHD had higher risks of depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, and agoraphobia than those without ADHD. Stimulant medications for ADHD were associated with a reduced risk for depression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 本系统综述与荟萃分析旨在全面评估注意力缺陷/多动障碍（ADHD）及其治疗药物对儿童青少年抑郁和焦虑风险的影响。截至2024年1月30日，我们系统检索了PubMed、Embase、Cochrane Library和Web of Science数据库，以抑郁和焦虑为结局指标，并根据发病年龄、性别及用药时长进行亚组分析，同时开展敏感性分析和发表偏倚评估。共纳入33项研究，结果显示：ADHD患儿罹患抑郁症的风险显著高于非ADHD群体[合并相对风险（RR）=2.27，95%置信区间（CI）=1.57-3.29，P<0.001]；重度抑郁症风险更高（合并RR=2.20，95%CI=1.47-3.29，P=0.002）；特定恐惧症风险增加（合并RR=1.68，95%CI=1.16-2.44，P=0.006）；社交恐惧症风险升高（合并RR=1.71，95%CI=1.13-2.61，P=0.012）；广场恐惧症风险显著提升（合并RR=4.99，95%CI=1.51-16.56，P=0.009）。使用兴奋剂类药物的ADHD患儿抑郁风险显著低于未用药组（合并RR=0.80，95%CI=0.72-0.89，P<0.001）。结论表明ADHD儿童青少年更易发生抑郁症、重度抑郁症、特定恐惧症、社交恐惧症及广场恐惧症，而兴奋剂类药物可降低抑郁风险。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 39740618 | specific phobia |

However, individuals suffering from anxiety disorders often do not seek treatment. These disorders impose a high individual and societal burden, especially on military personnel and their families, and place a significant burden on healthcare systems as care is often sought from primary care physicians rather than specialized professionals. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and correlates of anxiety among visitors at a Military Primary Health Center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 焦虑症很常见。然而，患有焦虑症的个体往往不寻求治疗。这些疾病给个人和社会带来了沉重负担，特别是对军人及其家庭而言，并对医疗系统造成显著压力，因为患者通常向初级保健医生而非专科医生求诊。本研究旨在确定某军事初级卫生中心就诊者中焦虑症的患病率及其相关因素。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 39722941 | specific phobia |

It has been more than 20 years since the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were conducted to examine changes in brain activation with anxiety-related treatments and more than 60 studies have since been published in this vein. For the current review, we conduct a systematic review of this literature, focusing on adult studies using task-based fMRI to measure brain activation changes with pharmacologic or psychotherapy interventions for phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroscientific theories of anxiety-related disorders and their treatment have focused on prefrontal-insula-amygdala networks. Treatment-related decreases in amygdala and/or anterior insula activation were identified as the most consistent finding across disorders, with the most consistent results reported for specific phobia. Directionality of change and specific regions implicated in the prefrontal cortex were inconsistent across studies. The potential importance for probing other networks and processes as mechanisms of anxiety treatment was recognized, such as striatal regions underlying inhibitory learning or reward responsivity. Future treatment-fMRI research related to anxiety disorders would benefit from larger sample sizes, use of more nuanced computational approaches, and increased focus on replication. There is continued promise that fMRI research will enhance our understanding of how treatments work and inform the evolution of more effective or personalized mental health treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 随着人类神经影像学的出现，研究者们被这样一个想法所吸引：通过更好地理解人类大脑，可以开发出更有效的心理健康干预措施。自首批利用功能磁共振成像（fMRI）研究焦虑相关治疗中大脑激活变化以来，已有20多年历史，相关领域发表了60多项研究。本文通过系统性文献综述，聚焦于采用任务态fMRI技术测量药物或心理治疗对恐惧症、社交焦虑障碍、惊恐障碍、广泛性焦虑障碍、创伤后应激障碍及强迫症成人患者脑激活改变的研究。焦虑相关障碍及其治疗的神经科学理论主要关注前额叶-岛叶-杏仁核网络。研究发现，跨诊断中最一致的疗效相关变化是杏仁核和/或前岛叶激活降低，其中特定恐惧症的研究结果一致性最高。但前额叶皮层变化方向及具体涉及脑区在不同研究间存在差异。研究者认识到探索其他神经网络和过程作为焦虑治疗机制的重要性，例如涉及抑制学习或奖赏反应的纹状体区域。未来焦虑障碍治疗-fMRI研究需扩大样本量、采用更精细的计算方法、加强结果可重复性验证。功能磁共振成像研究将持续为揭示治疗作用机制、发展更有效或个性化的心理健康治疗方案提供重要科学依据。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 39671067 | specific phobia |

Besides psycho-pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy with an exposure-based approach is considered the gold standard. However, not all patients benefit from this approach. Here, we aimed to translate laboratory findings on enhanced fear extinction with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the clinic. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 76 participants with acrophobia received an activating intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the left posterior prefrontal cortex immediately before two virtual reality exposure therapy sessions. Phobic symptoms were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and a 6-month follow-up. Results revealed a significant reduction in phobic symptoms from baseline to post-assessment and follow-up and confirmed the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy as a treatment for specific phobias. Interestingly, no additional effect was observed for active iTBS compared to sham iTBS. Our post-hoc analyses argue for an individualized TMS application. Further research is needed to determine optimal TMS parameters and validate these results in clinical trials, accounting for methodological and inter- and intra-individual variability, as well as alternative therapeutic processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 焦虑障碍是最普遍的心理健康问题。除精神药物治疗外，采用暴露疗法的认知行为治疗被视为黄金标准。然而并非所有患者都能从中获益。本研究旨在将重复经颅磁刺激（TMS）增强恐惧消退的实验室发现转化为临床应用。在这项双盲随机安慰剂对照临床试验中，76名恐高症受试者在两次虚拟现实暴露治疗前接受了针对左后前额叶皮层的激活型间歇性θ脉冲刺激（iTBS）。分别在基线期、干预后和6个月随访期评估恐惧症状。结果显示从基线到干预后及随访期恐惧症状显著减轻，证实了虚拟现实暴露疗法对特定恐惧症的治疗效果。值得注意的是，与伪刺激相比，主动iTBS并未显现额外疗效。我们的事后分析支持个体化TMS治疗方案。未来研究需确定最佳TMS参数，并通过临床试验验证这些结果，同时考虑方法论差异、个体间及个体内变异，以及其他治疗过程的影响。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 39604433 | specific phobia |

Additionally, research on the relationship between anxiety and BFRB symptoms has yielded inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis and systematic review examined (1) the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders in individuals with BFRB disorders and (2) correlations between anxiety and BFRB symptom measures. The study protocol was pre-registered on PROSPERO. A systematic search of PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 119 studies (N=15,902) reporting anxiety prevalence rates in BFRB disorders and/or correlations between anxiety and BFRBs. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, including subgroup analyses for TTM and SPD, and meta-regression to examine potential moderators. Results indicated that comorbid anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety, panic disorder, and specific phobia, were relatively common in BFRBs. Current prevalence rates were 19.2% for GAD, 12.8% for OCD, 10.6% for social anxiety, and 27.5% for 'any anxiety disorder.' Lifetime prevalence rates were 22.4% for GAD, 13.8% for OCD, 11.0% for social anxiety, and 35.9% for 'any anxiety disorder.' Pooled correlations between anxiety and BFRB severity were low to moderate (all BFRBs r=.29; TTM r=.27; SPD r=.34). Anxiety symptoms showed stronger correlations with focused BFRB measures (r=.42) than automatic (r=.15). These findings highlight a nuanced relationship between anxiety and BFRBs. While comorbid anxiety disorders are frequently observed in BFRB populations, anxiety severity is only modestly associated with BFRB severity. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 以身体为中心的重复行为障碍（BFRB），包括拔毛癖（TTM）和抠皮障碍（SPD），常与焦虑障碍共病，但报告的共病率差异较大。此外，关于焦虑与BFRB症状关系的研究结果并不一致。本项荟萃分析与系统评价探讨了：（1）BFRB患者中共病焦虑障碍的患病率；（2）焦虑与BFRB症状测量指标的相关性。研究方案已在PROSPERO平台预注册。通过系统检索PsycInfo、PubMed和Web of Science数据库，共纳入119项研究（样本量15,902人），这些研究报告了BFRB障碍的焦虑患病率和/或焦虑与BFRB的相关性。采用随机效应模型进行荟萃分析，包括对TTM和SPD的亚组分析，并通过元回归检验潜在调节因素。结果显示，广泛性焦虑障碍（GAD）、强迫症（OCD）、社交焦虑、惊恐障碍和特定恐惧症等共病焦虑障碍在BFRB患者中较为常见。当前患病率分别为：GAD 19.2%、OCD 12.8%、社交焦虑10.6%，"任何焦虑障碍"27.5%；终生患病率分别为：GAD 22.4%、OCD 13.8%、社交焦虑11.0%，"任何焦虑障碍"35.9%。焦虑与BFRB严重程度的合并相关性为低至中度（全部BFRB r=0.29；TTM r=0.27；SPD r=0.34）。与自动化行为（r=0.15）相比，焦虑症状与专注型BFRB测量指标（r=0.42）相关性更强。这些发现揭示了焦虑与BFRB之间复杂的关系：虽然BFRB人群中常见共病焦虑障碍，但焦虑严重程度与BFRB严重程度仅呈中等关联。文中讨论了未来研究和临床实践的启示。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 39603165 | specific phobia |

Animal phobias are the most prevalent forms of specific phobia among humans. Fear of snakes (snake phobia) is present in non-human primates which suggests its evolutionary origins as the ability to detect the threat of snakes was critical for survival. Snake phobia is a critical factor in protecting snakes and mitigating snakebite burden. To date, only one standardised psychometric test [the Snake Questionnaire (SNAQ) developed in 1974] has been used to quantify snake phobia although this was not performed in snakebite-endemic countries.

Among specific phobias, small animal phobia (SAP) denotes a particular condition that has been poorly investigated in the neuroscientific literature. Moreover, the few previous studies on this topic have mostly employed univariate analyses, with limited and unbalanced samples, leading to inconsistent results. To overcome these limitations, and to characterize the neural underpinnings of SAP, this study aims to develop a classification model of individuals with SAP based on gray matter features, by using a machine learning method known as the binary support vector machine. Moreover, the contribution of specific structural macro-networks, such as the default mode, the salience, the executive, and the affective networks, in separating phobic subjects from controls was assessed. Thirty-two subjects with SAP and 90 matched healthy controls were tested to this aim. At a whole-brain level, we found a significant predictive model including brain structures related to emotional regulation, cognitive control, and sensory integration, such as the cerebellum, the temporal pole, the frontal cortex, temporal lobes, the amygdala and the thalamus. Instead, when considering macro-networks analysis, we found the Default, the Affective, and partially the Central Executive and the Sensorimotor networks, to significantly outperform the other networks in classifying SAP individuals. In conclusion, this study expands knowledge about the neural basis of SAP, proposing new research directions and potential diagnostic strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 特定恐惧症代表了一类以特定刺激引发的强烈恐惧为特征的焦虑障碍。在各类特定恐惧症中，小型动物恐惧症（SAP）是一种在神经科学文献中研究不足的特殊病症。此前少数相关研究大多采用单变量分析方法，样本量有限且不平衡，导致结果不一致。为克服这些局限并揭示SAP的神经机制，本研究旨在通过二元支持向量机机器学习方法，基于灰质特征建立SAP患者的分类模型。此外，研究还评估了默认模式网络、突显网络、执行网络和情感网络等特定结构宏网络对区分恐惧症患者与健康对照组的贡献。为此我们对32名SAP患者和90名匹配的健康对照组进行了测试。在全脑水平上，我们发现了包含情绪调节、认知控制和感觉整合相关脑结构的显著预测模型，涉及小脑、颞极、额叶皮层、颞叶、杏仁核和丘脑等区域。而在宏网络分析中，默认网络、情感网络以及部分中央执行网络和感觉运动网络在SAP个体分类中的表现显著优于其他网络。本研究拓展了关于SAP神经基础的认识，为未来研究方向和潜在诊断策略提供了新思路。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 39467845 | specific phobia |

This is crucial as previous studies have been unable to distinguish between engagement, disengagement, and behavioral freezing. Thirty-three participants (Mage = 28.75 years, SD = 8.98; 21 women) with self-reported specific phobia (spiders, snakes, and pointed objects) and their matched controls (Mage = 28.38 years, SD = 8.66; 21 women) took part in the experiment. The participants were instructed to initially focus on a picture in the center of the screen, then search for a target picture in an outer circle consisting of six images, and respond via a button press whether the object in the target picture was oriented to the left or right. We found that phobic individuals show delayed disengagement and slower decision times compared with non-phobic individuals, regardless of whether the stimulus was threat-related or neutral. These results indicate that phobic individuals tend to exhibit poorer attentional control mechanisms and problems inhibiting irrelevant information. We also confirmed a threat-unrelated shared feature effect with complex stimuli (delayed disengagement when an attended stimulus and an unattended target share common stimulus features). This process might play a role in various experimental setups investigating attentional disengagement that has not yet been considered. These findings are important, as good attentional control may serve as a protective mechanism against anxiety disorders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 本研究采用新型视觉搜索范式结合眼动追踪技术，专门考察威胁相关注意偏向中的注意脱离机制。这一突破至关重要，因为既往研究无法区分注意投入、脱离和行为冻结三种成分。33名自述特定恐惧症患者（蜘蛛/蛇/尖锐物体；平均年龄28.75±8.98岁；女性21人）及匹配对照组（平均年龄28.38±8.66岁；女性21人）参与实验。任务要求受试者先注视屏幕中央图片，随后在外围六张图片中搜索目标，按键判断目标物朝向（左/右）。研究发现：恐惧症患者无论面对威胁或中性刺激，均表现出更慢的注意脱离速度和决策延迟，表明其注意控制机制较弱，抑制无关信息能力较差。实验同时证实了复杂刺激下无关威胁的共享特征效应（当被注意刺激与无关目标具有共同特征时，注意脱离延迟）。这一机制可能影响多种注意脱离实验范式，却长期被忽视。研究发现具有重要意义，因为良好的注意控制能力可能是预防焦虑障碍的保护性因素。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 39388014 | specific phobia |

It remains uncertain how much these signatures overlap across different phenotypes due to a lack of well-powered cross-disorder comparisons. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate differences in functional connectivity (FC) in a cross-disorder sample of AD patients and healthy controls (HC). Before treatment, 439 patients from two German multicenter clinical trials at eight different sites fulfilling a primary diagnosis of panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (PD/AG, N = 154), social anxiety disorder (SAD, N = 95), or specific phobia (SP, N = 190) and 105 HC underwent an 8 min rsfMRI assessment. We performed categorical and dimensional regions of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses focusing on connectivity between regions of the defensive system and prefrontal regulation areas. AD patients showed increased connectivity between the insula and the thalamus compared to controls. This was mainly driven by PD/AG patients who showed increased (insula/hippocampus/amygdala-thalamus) and decreased (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/periaqueductal gray-anterior cingulate cortex) positive connectivity between subcortical and cortical areas. In contrast, SAD patients showed decreased negative connectivity exclusively in cortical areas (insula-orbitofrontal cortex), whereas no differences were found in SP patients. State anxiety associated with the scanner environment did not explain the FC between these regions. Only PD/AG patients showed pronounced connectivity changes along a widespread subcortical-cortical network, including the midbrain. Dimensional analyses yielded no significant results. The results highlighting categorical differences between ADs at a systems neuroscience level are discussed within the context of personalized neuroscience-informed treatments.

Despite significant research on the topic of FoB, studies investigating various forms of maltreatment and mental health symptoms in relation to FoB are very limited. In particular, studies including multiple forms of maltreatment along with mental health symptoms as predictors of FoB are extremely limited. We sought to fill this gap and clarify the relative contributions of these variables to the prediction of FoB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 大多数孕妇都会在一定程度上经历分娩恐惧（FoB），其严重程度可能足以需要治疗。尽管关于FoB的研究很多，但探讨不同形式的虐待和心理健康症状与FoB关系的研究却非常有限。特别是将多种形式的虐待与心理健康症状共同作为FoB预测因素的研究更是极为少见。我们试图填补这一空白，并明确这些变量在预测FoB中的相对贡献。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 39343311 | specific phobia |
| Reality Cheque: Different Methods of Eliciting Fear-Related Beliefs Reveal Multiple Representations of Threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 现实检验：引发恐惧相关信念的不同方法揭示了威胁的多重表征。                                                                 | Elsey James W B, Metselaar Vivian N, Geiser Elias, Knoop Donna F, Gangadien Suraya M et al.                                    | The Journal of general psychology (2025)                                              | Influential models of fears and phobias suggest that irrational threat beliefs underpin excessive fear. Yet, many fearful individuals recognize their fear is not justified. Drawing on memory competition/multiple representations theory, we developed a novel, fear-relevant procedure, which reveals conflicting representations of threat. In three experiments (Experiment 1, N = 49, Experiment 2, N = 47, Experiment 3, N = 75), fearful and non-fearful participants not only provided Probability Ratings for fear-related outcomes in a fear-relevant exposure task, but placed Bets, with payoffs depending on what happened in reality. Fearful participants displayed much higher Probability Ratings than Low fear participants. However, Bets revealed far less consistent group differences, even when proximal to threat (Experiments 1 and 2), and differences between High and Low fear participants' Bets disappeared when they could not be anchored to previous Probability Ratings (Experiment 3). A Neutral Betting task also showed that general betting strategies were comparable between groups. We suggest that these findings may reflect the multi-representational nature of belief, in which both adaptive and maladaptive representations of a feared object may exist in parallel, with personal and contextual factors determining which form of representation is retrieved or expressed. This perspective can provide insights into the complex interplay of adaptive and maladaptive beliefs that is a central focus of currently dominant therapies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 关于恐惧和恐惧症的有影响力模型认为，非理性的威胁信念是过度恐惧的基础。然而，许多恐惧者意识到自己的恐惧并不合理。基于记忆竞争/多重表征理论，我们开发了一种新颖的、与恐惧相关的程序，揭示了威胁表征之间的冲突。在三个实验中（实验1，N=49；实验2，N=47；实验3，N=75），恐惧和非恐惧参与者不仅在一个与恐惧相关的暴露任务中对恐惧相关结果进行了概率评估，还下了赌注，其回报取决于现实中的结果。恐惧参与者的概率评估远高于低恐惧参与者。然而，赌注显示出的群体差异要小得多，即使在接近威胁时（实验1和2），当无法将赌注与先前的概率评估锚定时，高恐惧和低恐惧参与者之间的赌注差异消失了（实验3）。一个中性的赌注任务也显示，两组的总体赌注策略是可比的。我们认为，这些发现可能反映了信念的多重表征性质，即对恐惧对象的适应性和非适应性表征可能同时存在，个人和情境因素决定了哪种表征形式被提取或表达。这一视角可以为适应性和非适应性信念之间复杂的相互作用提供见解，这是当前主流疗法的核心关注点。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 39306831 | specific phobia |

Neurofeedback-Assisted Mindfulness Training Programs may prove beneficials for improving self-control abilities, a key ability in addressing addictive behaviors. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact, in a young population aged 18-35 years, of an intervention based on Neurofeedback-Assisted Mindfulness Training Program (NAMTP) on disorders associated with problematic use of mobile phones. The effect of the intervention on the total score in the nomophobia test and habits of internet and social network use, as well as on signs of depression, anxiety and stress will be analyzed.

These conditions are characterized by excessive anxiety that is difficult to control. In most anxiety disorders, symptoms are triggered by exposure to specific objects or situations. This leads sufferers to avoid such exposures, leading to impaired social and occupational functioning and reduced quality of life. Therapies based on behavioral principles, either alone or in combination with cognitive techniques, are the most effective psychological interventions for anxiety disorders. However, the effectiveness of these therapies may be limited due to a lack of generalization from clinic to real-world settings. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that provides an interactive experience by superimposing computer-generated content, often in multiple sensory modalities, on the real world. Emerging evidence suggests that AR may be useful in treating a broad range of mental disorders, including anxiety disorders. This review examines the evidence for the use of AR-based techniques as an aid to behavioral or cognitive-behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders. The available evidence suggests that this method may offer significant advantages over conventional therapies, particularly in the case of specific phobias, but also in social anxiety disorder. AR can also be combined with other novel technologies to monitor psychophysiological markers of anxiety and its reduction over the course of treatment. The advantages of AR could be related to its combination of real and simulated content, allowing for better generalization of the benefits of conventional exposure-based therapy. Though the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of this method need to be confirmed in larger samples, it could lead to a paradigm shift in the way behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders are conceptualized and delivered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 焦虑障碍是全球最常见的精神障碍之一。这类疾病以难以控制的过度焦虑为特征。在大多数焦虑障碍中，特定物体或情境会触发症状，导致患者主动回避这些刺激，进而损害社会职业功能并降低生活质量。基于行为学原理的疗法（单独使用或结合认知技术）是焦虑障碍最有效的心理干预手段，但由于临床环境与现实场景的脱节，这些疗法的效果可能受限。增强现实（AR）技术通过将计算机生成的多感官内容叠加到现实世界，提供交互式体验。新近证据表明，AR可能对包括焦虑障碍在内的多种精神障碍治疗具有价值。本文综述了AR技术辅助行为或认知行为疗法治疗焦虑障碍的证据。现有数据表明，该方法相比传统疗法可能具有显著优势——尤其针对特定恐惧症和社交焦虑障碍。AR还可与其他新兴技术结合，监测治疗过程中焦虑相关心理生理指标及其变化。AR的优势可能源于其虚实结合的特性，能更好地实现传统暴露疗法效果的迁移应用。虽然该方法的安全性、有效性和成本效益仍需大样本验证，但它可能引发焦虑障碍行为疗法在理念和实施方式上的范式变革。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 39282478 | specific phobia |

The COVID-19 Phobia Scale, previously validated as a four-factor structure, is a widely used multidimensional measure to assess coronaphobia. The current study scrutinized various competing factor structures of this instrument to identify the optimal psychometric representation of coronaphobia. Adults (N = 412) ranging in age from 19 to 84 years completed the COVID-19 Phobia Scale. Several theoretically plausible factor structures of coronaphobia were tested and compared using confirmatory factor analysis: four-factor structure, one-factor structure, higher-order factor structure, and five-factor bifactor structure. The one-factor structure showing an overarching factor of COVID-19 phobia revealed the poorest fit to the data. The five-factor bifactor structure that allowed every item to double-load on the COVID-19 general phobia factor alongside one of the COVID-19 specific phobia factors (psychological phobia, psycho-somatic phobia, economic phobia, or social phobia) produced the strongest fit indices and was superior to the widely accepted four-factor structure. The five-factor bifactor structure demonstrated multi-group measurement invariance across gender, race, age, and state urbanization. Furthermore, the general phobia factor and the psycho-somatic phobia factor from the five-factor bifactor structure uniquely predicted present moment state anxiety using structural equation modeling. This psychometric investigation underscores that coronaphobia is experienced as a general pandemic fear that is simultaneously experienced with specific domains of pandemic fears. Theoretical and methodological insights are offered for conceptualizing and measuring coronaphobia and understanding how pandemic phobias differ from traditional phobias.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 新冠恐惧症是指由COVID-19病毒及大流行引发的恐惧与恐惧症。先前被验证为四因子结构的COVID-19恐惧量表是评估新冠恐惧症的常用多维测量工具。本研究通过验证性因子分析检验了该量表的多种竞争性因子结构，以确定新冠恐惧症的最佳心理测量表征。412名19至84岁的成年人完成了该量表测试。研究对比测试了四种理论可行的因子结构模型：四因子模型、单因子模型、高阶因子模型以及五因子双因子模型。其中将COVID-19恐惧作为单一整体因子的单因子模型显示出最差的数据拟合度。而五因子双因子模型（允许所有条目在COVID-19普遍恐惧因子的基础上，同时负荷于四个特定恐惧因子之一：心理恐惧、身心恐惧、经济恐惧或社交恐惧）则呈现出最优拟合指标，其表现优于被广泛认可的四因子结构。该五因子双因子结构在性别、种族、年龄和居住地城市化程度等人口学变量上均具有跨组测量等值性。通过结构方程模型进一步发现，五因子双因子结构中的普遍恐惧因子与身心恐惧因子能独特预测个体即时状态焦虑。这项心理测量研究表明，新冠恐惧症既表现为普遍的大流行恐惧，又同时存在于特定领域的疫情恐惧中。研究为新冠恐惧症的概念化测量、以及理解大流行恐惧症与传统恐惧症的差异提供了理论与方法论启示。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 39141996 | specific phobia |

There is no consensus yet on which emotions are involved in Trypophobia nor in its functional utility. This report investigates the role of disgust using contamination tasks in two studies, which contrast people with an aversion to trypophobic stimuli to those without. In Study 1, participants reported their emotional reactions to imagined contamination of trypophobic images. In Study 2, participants evaluated physically present trypophobic, disgust, fear, and control stimuli. The capacity of these stimuli to contaminate other objects was established using a chain of contagion task. Across both studies, contamination was present, however, only those with an aversion to trypophobic stimuli evidenced contamination on the chain of contagion task, a hallmark of disgust responding. Elevated levels were not only reported for disgust, but also alongside fear/anxiety. Participant reports suggest an underlying disease avoidance mechanism in Trypophobia, with trypophobic participants demonstrating an exaggerated response to such stimuli involving disgust and fear/anxiety, which is also seen in small animal phobia, BII, and C-OCD. Implications, particularly for treatment are discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 密集恐惧症是一种相对常见的对密集孔洞的厌恶反应。目前关于密集恐惧症涉及何种情绪及其功能效用尚未达成共识。本报告通过两项污染任务研究探讨了厌恶情绪的作用，研究对比了对密集恐惧刺激有厌恶反应和无反应的人群。在研究1中，参与者报告了他们对想象中密集恐惧图像污染的 emotional reactions。在研究2中，参与者评估了实际存在的密集恐惧、厌恶、恐惧和控制刺激。这些刺激污染其他物体的能力通过传染链任务进行验证。两项研究均显示污染效应存在，但只有对密集恐惧刺激有厌恶反应的参与者在传染链任务中表现出污染效应，这是厌恶反应的标志性特征。不仅厌恶情绪水平升高，恐惧/焦虑情绪也同时升高。参与者报告表明密集恐惧症存在潜在的疾病回避机制，密集恐惧症参与者对此类刺激表现出涉及厌恶和恐惧/焦虑的过度反应，这种反应也见于小动物恐惧症、血液-注射-损伤恐惧症和污染型强迫症。文中还讨论了相关启示，尤其是对治疗的启示。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 39120561 | specific phobia |

Seven online databases were systematically searched. 173 RCTs met inclusion criteria, of which 67 qualified for 14 pooled analyses. To alleviate state anxiety during oral surgery, moderate-certainty evidence supports employing hypnosis (SMD=-0.31, 95 %CI[-0.56,-0.05]), and low-certainty evidence supports prescribing benzodiazepines (SMD=-0.43, [-0.74,-0.12]). Evidence for reducing state anxiety is inconclusive regarding psychotherapy, and does not support virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), virtual reality distraction, music, aromatherapy, video information and acupuncture. To reduce trait anxiety, moderate-certainty evidence supports using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; SMD=-0.65, [-1.06, -0.24]). Regarding dental phobia, evidence with low-to-moderate certainty supports employing psychotherapy (SMD=-0.48, [-0.72,-0.24]), and CBT specifically (SMD=-0.43, [-0.68,-0.17]), but not VRET. These results show that dental anxieties are manageable and treatable. Clinicians should ensure that interventions match their purpose-managing acute emotions during treatment, or alleviating chronic anxiety and avoidance tendencies. Existing research gaps underscore the necessity for future trials to minimize bias and follow CONSORT reporting guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 本综述评估了针对成人状态性焦虑（牙科治疗期间的恐惧与情绪困扰）、慢性牙科（特质性）焦虑或牙科恐惧症（异常高的特质性焦虑；符合特定恐惧症诊断标准）进行干预的随机对照试验（RCT）。通过系统检索7个在线数据库，共纳入173项符合标准的RCT，其中67项纳入14项合并分析。缓解口腔手术状态性焦虑方面，中等质量证据支持使用催眠疗法（SMD=-0.31，95%CI[-0.56,-0.05]），低质量证据支持苯二氮卓类药物（SMD=-0.43，[-0.74,-0.12]）。心理疗法对减轻状态性焦虑的证据尚不明确，而虚拟现实暴露疗法（VRET）、虚拟现实分心技术、音乐疗法、芳香疗法、视频宣教及针灸均未显示有效性。针对特质性焦虑，中等质量证据支持认知行为疗法（CBT；SMD=-0.65，[-1.06,-0.24]）。对于牙科恐惧症，低至中等质量证据支持心理疗法（SMD=-0.48，[-0.72,-0.24]）及特异性CBT（SMD=-0.43，[-0.68,-0.17]），但VRET无效。结果表明牙科焦虑具有可管理性和可治疗性。临床工作者应确保干预措施与目标匹配——是控制治疗中的急性情绪反应，还是缓解慢性焦虑及回避倾向。现有研究空白凸显未来试验需减少偏倚并遵循CONSORT报告规范的必要性。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 38945067 | specific phobia |

This systematic work investigates iVRET's effectiveness in modulating disgust emotion-a shared aberrant feature across these disorders. Recent reviews have evaluated VRET's efficacy against in vivo ET. However, emerging evidence also highlights iVRET's potential in diminishing atypical disgust and related avoidance behaviors, expanding beyond traditional fear-focused outcomes. Our systematic synthesis, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, aims to fill this gap by assessing iVRET's efficacy in regulating disgust emotion within both clinical and at-risk populations, identified through standardized questionnaires and subjective disgust ratings. This research analyzes data from eight studies on clinical populations and five on healthy populations, offering an insight into iVRET's potential to mitigate the aberrant disgust response, a common transdiagnostic feature in varied psychopathologies. The findings support iVRET's clinical relevance in disgust management, providing evidence for a broader therapeutic application of iVRET and pointing out the need for more focused and complete investigations in this emergent field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 虚拟现实暴露疗法（VRET），尤其是沉浸式虚拟现实暴露疗法（iVRET），作为一种创新的暴露治疗手段，在针对某些伴随污染恐惧的焦虑障碍（如蜘蛛恐惧症和强迫症）中备受关注。本系统性研究探讨了iVRET在调节厌恶情绪方面的有效性——这种情绪是上述疾病共有的异常特征。近期综述已评估了VRET相较于真实暴露疗法的效果，而新证据进一步表明iVRET不仅能改善传统恐惧症状，还能有效减轻非典型厌恶及相关回避行为。我们遵循PRISMA指南进行系统综述，旨在通过标准化问卷和主观厌恶评分，评估iVRET在临床人群和高危人群中调控厌恶情绪的疗效，填补该领域研究空白。研究分析了8项临床人群研究和5项健康人群研究数据，揭示了iVRET在缓解多种精神病理共有的跨诊断特征——异常厌恶反应方面的潜力。研究结果证实了iVRET在厌恶情绪管理中的临床价值，为其更广泛的治疗应用提供了依据，同时指出这一新兴领域需要更深入全面的研究探索。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 38790488 | specific phobia |

We aimed to examine absolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies across eight mental disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD). We used a series of living systematic reviews included in the Metapsy initiative (www.metapsy.org), with a common strategy for literature search, inclusion of studies and extraction of data, and a common format for the analyses. Literature search was conducted in major bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials) up to January 1, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials comparing psychotherapies for any of the eight mental disorders, established by a diagnostic interview, with a control group (waitlist, care-as-usual, or pill placebo). We conducted random-effects model pairwise meta-analyses. The main outcome was the absolute rate of response (at least 50% symptom reduction between baseline and post-test) in the treatment and control conditions. Secondary outcomes included the relative risk (RR) of response, and the number needed to treat (NNT). Random-effects meta-analyses of the included 441 trials (33,881 patients) indicated modest response rates for psychotherapies: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.39-0.45) for MDD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33-0.43) for PTSD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30-0.47) for OCD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33-0.43) for panic disorder; 0.36 (95% CI: 0.30-0.42) for GAD; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.29-0.37) for social anxiety disorder; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.23-0.42) for specific phobia; and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.15-0.36) for BPD. Most sensitivity analyses broadly supported these findings. The RRs were significant for all disorders, except BPD. Our conclusion is that most psychotherapies for the eight mental disorders are effective compared with control conditions, but absolute response rates are modest. More effective treatments and interventions for those not responding to a first-line treatment are needed.                        | 心理治疗是大多数精神障碍的一线治疗方法，但其绝对疗效（即反应率和缓解率）尚未得到充分研究，尽管这些信息对医疗保健使用者、提供者和政策制定者具有重要意义。我们旨在评估八种精神障碍心理治疗的绝对和相对疗效：重性抑郁障碍（MDD）、社交焦虑障碍、惊恐障碍、广泛性焦虑障碍（GAD）、特定恐惧症、创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）、强迫症（OCD）和边缘型人格障碍（BPD）。我们采用了Metapsy项目（www.metapsy.org）中的一系列动态系统评价，使用统一的文献检索策略、研究纳入标准和数据提取方法，并采用统一的分析格式。文献检索在主要书目数据库（PubMed、PsycINFO、Embase和Cochrane对照试验中心注册库）中进行，截止日期为2023年1月1日。我们纳入了针对这八种精神障碍（通过诊断访谈确认）的心理治疗与对照组（等待名单、常规治疗或安慰剂）比较的随机对照试验。我们进行了随机效应模型的成对荟萃分析。主要结果是治疗组和对照组的绝对反应率（基线至治疗后症状减轻至少50%）。次要结果包括相对风险（RR）和需治疗人数（NNT）。对纳入的441项试验（33,881名患者）进行的随机效应荟萃分析显示，心理治疗的反应率较为有限：MDD为0.42（95% CI：0.39-0.45）；PTSD为0.38（95% CI：0.33-0.43）；OCD为0.38（95% CI：0.30-0.47）；惊恐障碍为0.38（95% CI：0.33-0.43）；GAD为0.36（95% CI：0.30-0.42）；社交焦虑障碍为0.32（95% CI：0.29-0.37）；特定恐惧症为0.32（95% CI：0.23-0.42）；BPD为0.24（95% CI：0.15-0.36）。大多数敏感性分析广泛支持这些发现。除BPD外，所有障碍的RR均显著。我们的结论是，针对这八种精神障碍的大多数心理治疗与对照组相比是有效的，但绝对反应率有限。需要开发更有效的治疗方法，并为对一线治疗无反应的患者提供干预措施。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 38727072 | specific phobia |

For instance, in spider phobia, participants or patients gradually approach a live spider until they feel too uncomfortable to continue. However, the use of different BAT protocols in various studies hampers the comparability of results. Moreover, conducting the test requires considerable preparation by researchers and clinicians. Thus, we have developed an open-access online BAT (vBATon). We validated its efficacy in measuring avoidance behavior and eliciting feelings of anxiety and disgust by comparing it to a real-life BAT (rl-BAT). Spider-fearful (N = 31) and nonfearful (N = 31) individuals completed a rl-BAT and vBATon on two separate dates within a 1-week interval. As expected, both tests successfully distinguished between spider-fearful and nonfearful individuals. Crucially, equivalence tests confirmed that vBATon captures avoidance behavior, anxiety, and disgust equal to the rl-BAT. Assessing validity, we found moderate to high correlations between vBATon and (a) the rl-BAT and (b) self-report measurements of spider fear (Spider Phobia Questionnaire, Fear of Spiders Questionnaire). Overall, our study displayed initial evidence of validity of vBATon and suggests that it is a standardized, efficient, and user-friendly alternative to rl-BATs for measuring spider fear. It can be utilized in both research and clinical practice.

Summer camps may provide an effective treatment avenue for youth who might not otherwise have access to care. This study describes the design and implementation of Fear Facers, a semistructured, 5-day, daytime exposure-therapy-based summer camp designed for youth with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety, separation anxiety, or a specific phobia. Preliminary data regarding feasibility and patient outcomes is also reported. Among 52 children and adolescents aged 7 to 16 who attended one of six camp sessions between 2018 and 2021, significant reductions in anxiety (d = 0.54) and OCD symptoms (d = 0.57) were observed from pre-camp to immediately post-camp. A subset of campers who were followed for an additional 3 months post-camp (n = 22) showed maintenance of treatment gains. Retention rates for the intervention were high. Our investigation provides further support for the use of a camp-based design for cognitive-behavioral approaches, and may provide a unique setting to maximize elements of inhibitory learning in exposures. We also discuss a number of elements regarding feasibility that need consideration for those hoping to develop similar interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 尽管焦虑症在儿童和青少年中普遍存在，且已有基于证据的有效治疗方法，但获得心理护理仍是公共卫生领域的主要问题。对于无法获得常规护理的青少年而言，夏令营可能提供了一条有效的治疗途径。本研究描述了"恐惧征服者"夏令营的设计与实施——这是一个为期5天、以日间暴露疗法为基础的中结构化夏令营，专为主要诊断为强迫症（OCD）、社交焦虑、分离焦虑或特定恐惧症的青少年设计。研究还报告了关于可行性和患者疗效的初步数据。在2018至2021年间参加六期夏令营的52名7至16岁青少年中，从入营前到结营时观察到焦虑症状（d=0.54）和强迫症状（d=0.57）显著减轻。对其中22名营员进行的3个月追踪随访显示，治疗效果得以维持。该干预方案的参与保留率较高。我们的研究为基于夏令营设计的认知行为疗法提供了进一步支持，并可能为最大化暴露疗法中的抑制性学习要素提供独特环境。我们还讨论了开发类似干预措施时需考虑的若干可行性要素。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 38670667 | specific phobia |

A total of 84 patients who underwent GC surgery were included in this study. The fear of progression questionnaire-short form and social support rating scale were conducted, and multiple linear regression was performed to identify risk factors of FCR. The score of the fear of progression questionnaire-short form in patients with GC surgery was 39.1 ± 7.6. The results of multiple linear regression showed that age, education level, occupational status, course of the disease, Tumor node metastasis staging, and social support were the influencing factors of FCR in patients with GC (P < .05). The current situation of FCR in patients with GC surgery is not optimistic. The medical staff should pay more attention to patients with low age, low education level, unemployment, short course, high tumor node metastasis staging, low social support level, and other high-risk groups, and provide social support resources to reduce the level of FCR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 探讨胃癌术后患者癌症复发恐惧（FCR）的危险因素，为制定针对性护理干预措施提供参考。本研究共纳入84例胃癌手术患者，采用疾病进展恐惧量表简表和社会支持评定量表进行调查，并通过多元线性回归分析FCR的危险因素。胃癌手术患者的疾病进展恐惧量表简表得分为39.1±7.6分。多元线性回归结果显示，年龄、文化程度、职业状态、病程、TNM分期和社会支持是胃癌患者FCR的影响因素（P<0.05）。胃癌手术患者FCR现状不容乐观，医护人员应重点关注低龄、低文化程度、无业、病程短、TNM分期高、社会支持水平低等高危人群，并提供社会支持资源以降低其FCR水平。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 38489733 | specific phobia |

However, little is known about the psychopathological details of tokophobia (fear of childbirth). Between 2020 and 2021, a total of 10 pregnant women (nine nulliparae and one multipara) with a strong fear of childbirth were referred by obstetricians. Semi-structured psychopathological interviews were conducted, and two cases were judged to have obsession, three an overvalued idea, and one secondary delusion. Three were characterised by both obsession and overvalued idea and one by both obsession and secondary delusion. In total, six cases had features of an overvalued idea. All of the participants except one had a lifetime history of a specific phobia. In addition, their history included social phobia in two cases, panic disorder in one case, obsessive-compulsive disorder (other than tokophobia) in two cases, depressive disorder in two cases, bipolar disorder in two cases, and PTSD in six cases. To conclude, this study showed that tokophobia was not a phobic disorder but a kind of overvalued idea that requires specific assessment and treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 分娩恐惧症被认为是一些孕妇对分娩的强烈恐惧。然而，目前对分娩恐惧症（对分娩的恐惧）的精神病理学细节知之甚少。2020年至2021年间，共有10名对分娩有强烈恐惧的孕妇（9名初产妇和1名经产妇）由产科医生转诊。通过半结构化精神病理学访谈，其中2例被判定为强迫症，3例为超价观念，1例为继发性妄想。3例同时具有强迫症和超价观念特征，1例同时具有强迫症和继发性妄想特征。总共有6例表现出超价观念的特点。除1例外，所有参与者均有特定恐惧症的终身病史。此外，他们的病史还包括：2例社交恐惧症，1例恐慌症，2例强迫症（非分娩恐惧症），2例抑郁症，2例双相情感障碍，以及6例创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）。综上所述，本研究表明，分娩恐惧症并非恐惧症，而是一种需要特定评估和治疗的超价观念。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 38470630 | specific phobia |

The identification of pre-treatment response-predicting patient characteristics may enable patient stratification. Preliminary research highlights the relevance of inhibitory fronto-limbic networks as such. We aimed to identify pre-treatment neural signatures differing between exposure treatment responders and non-responders in spider phobia and to validate results through rigorous replication. Data of a bi-centric intervention study comprised clinical phenotyping and pre-treatment resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data of n = 79 patients with spider phobia (discovery sample) and n = 69 patients (replication sample). RsFC data analyses were accomplished using the Matlab-based CONN-toolbox with harmonized analyses protocols at both sites. Treatment response was defined by a reduction of >30% symptom severity from pre- to post-treatment (Spider Phobia Questionnaire Score, primary outcome). Secondary outcome was defined by a reduction of >50% in a Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT). Mean within-session fear reduction functioned as a process measure for exposure. Compared to non-responders and pre-treatment, results in the discovery sample seemed to indicate that responders exhibited stronger negative connectivity between frontal and limbic structures and were characterized by heightened connectivity between the amygdala and ventral visual pathway regions. Patients exhibiting high within-session fear reduction showed stronger excitatory connectivity within the prefrontal cortex than patients with low within-session fear reduction. Whereas these results could be replicated by another team using the same data (cross-team replication), cross-site replication of the discovery sample findings in the independent replication sample was unsuccessful. Results seem to support negative fronto-limbic connectivity as promising ingredient to enhance response rates in specific phobia but lack sufficient replication. Further research is needed to obtain a valid basis for clinical decision-making and the development of individually tailored treatment options. Notably, future studies should regularly include replication approaches in their protocols.                                                                     | 虽然暴露疗法对焦虑症患者普遍高效，但疗效因人而异。通过识别治疗前能预测疗效的患者特征，可能实现患者分层。初步研究强调了前额叶-边缘抑制网络的关键作用。本研究旨在发现蜘蛛恐惧症患者中暴露治疗有效者与无效者的治疗前神经特征差异，并通过严格复现验证结果。一项双中心干预研究收集了79名蜘蛛恐惧症患者（探索样本）和69名患者（复现样本）的临床表型及治疗前静息态功能连接（rsFC）数据。采用基于Matlab的CONN工具箱进行rsFC数据分析，两中心使用统一分析方案。治疗有效性定义为治疗后症状严重程度降低>30%（蜘蛛恐惧问卷评分，主要指标），次要指标为行为回避测试（BAT）得分降低>50%。单次治疗期间的恐惧减轻程度作为暴露治疗的过程指标。探索样本结果显示，与无效者相比，有效者治疗前表现出更强的额叶-边缘结构负向连接，以及杏仁核与腹侧视觉通路区域更强的连接性。单次治疗恐惧减轻显著的患者前额叶皮层内兴奋性连接更强。虽然另一团队使用相同数据成功复现了这些结果（跨团队复现），但在独立复现样本中未能实现跨中心复现。研究结果支持额叶-边缘负向连接作为提高特定恐惧症疗效的潜在靶点，但尚需充分复现验证。未来研究需建立更可靠的临床决策基础以开发个体化治疗方案，并建议将复现设计纳入常规研究流程。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 38453896 | specific phobia |

We hypothesize that a gamified VRET augmented with BF will yield more positive effects than a similar device lacking BF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 据我们所知，目前伊朗乃至全球尚未开展针对恐猫症（ailurophobia）的专项研究。这一现状、恐猫症的普遍性，以及缺乏结合经济型易获取生物反馈（BF）技术的游戏化虚拟现实暴露疗法（VRET），共同推动了本项目的开展。我们假设：相较于未配备生物反馈的同类设备，搭载生物反馈技术的游戏化VRET将产生更积极的治疗效果。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 38446522 | specific phobia |

However, studies targeting Dental Phobia (DP) yielded quite heterogeneous results and research concerning the effects of exposure treatments on phobic brain activation so far is missing. This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study aimed to investigate activation patterns in DP patients during exposure to phobia-related stimuli and the effects of an exposure-based fear treatment on phobia-related activation. Seventeen patients with DP and seventeen non-phobic, healthy controls participated in this fMRI experiment presenting dental-related and neutral auditory and visual stimuli. After completing a short exposure-based CBT program, patients were scanned a second time to illustrate treatment-related changes in brain activation patterns. Pre-treatment fMRI results demonstrate enhanced activation in DP-patients mainly in the precuneus and lateral parietal cortex. Moreover, a small activation focus was observed in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as parts of classically fear-related structures. Activation in all these clusters decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment assessment and in the case of the ACC was correlated with dental fear reduction. Activation changes in the precuneus and lateral parietal cortex suggest a pronounced first-person perspective memory processing including a vivid recall of contextual information from an egocentric perspective triggered by exposure to phobia-related stimuli. Besides a treatment-sensitive hyperactivity of fear-sensitive structures, DP may also be characterized by a disturbed memory retrieval that can be reorganized by successful exposure treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 特定恐惧症患者不恰当的防御准备被认为源于大脑防御动员网络的过度激活。然而针对牙科恐惧症（DP）的研究结果存在较大异质性，且目前缺乏关于暴露治疗对恐惧相关脑区激活影响的研究。这项功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）研究旨在探究DP患者在恐惧相关刺激暴露期间的脑区激活模式，以及基于暴露的恐惧治疗对恐惧相关脑区激活的影响。17名DP患者与17名非恐惧的健康对照者参与了呈现牙科相关及中性视听刺激的fMRI实验。完成短期暴露认知行为治疗后，患者接受第二次扫描以显示治疗相关的脑激活模式变化。治疗前fMRI结果显示DP患者主要在楔前叶和外侧顶叶皮层呈现增强激活，同时在经典恐惧相关结构（如杏仁核和前扣带回皮层ACC）观察到小范围激活焦点。这些脑区的激活水平从治疗前到治疗后评估均显著下降，其中ACC激活程度与牙科恐惧症状减轻相关。楔前叶和外侧顶叶皮层的激活变化表明，恐惧相关刺激暴露会触发以第一人称视角进行的记忆加工过程，包括从自我中心角度对情境信息的生动回忆。除恐惧敏感结构的治疗敏感性亢进外，DP可能还以记忆提取功能紊乱为特征，这种紊乱可通过成功的暴露治疗得到重组。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 38424282 | specific phobia |

Neurodegenerative conditions with significant memory loss such as Alzheimer's disease, testify how defects of memory persistence have severe and irreversible effects on personality, among other symptoms. Yet, maintenance of overly strong maladaptive memories underlies highly debilitating psychiatric conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, specific phobia, substance dependence and binge eating disorder. Here we review the neurobiological mechanisms supporting memory formation, persistence, inhibition and forgetting. We then shift the focus to how such mechanisms have been exploited to alter the persistence of laboratory-generated memories in human healthy volunteers as a proof of concept.

Sie zählt zu den spezifischen Phobien. Die Emetophobie ist eine bisher noch wenig erforschte Erkrankung. Über Ursachen und Prävalenz ist nur wenig bekannt, zudem fehlt es an systematisch gesichertem Wissen zur Behandlung. Die meisten Studien weisen jedoch darauf hin, dass die Emetophobie überwiegend Frauen betrifft, früh in der Kindheit beginnt, meist einen chronischen Verlauf nimmt, mit psychischen Komorbiditäten einhergeht und Betroffene oft aus Scham nicht von ihrem Leiden berichten. Die kognitive Verhaltenstherapie (KVT) mit Exposition und Reaktionsmanagement scheint das derzeit wirksamste Therapieverfahren zur Behandlung der Emetophobie. Wir berichten über den Fall einer 20-jährigen Frau, die initial wegen einer schweren depressiven Episode zur stationär-psychiatrischen Krankenhausbehandlung aufgenommen wurde. Das Erkennen der Emetophobie war dadurch erschwert, dass die Patientin aus Scham nicht spontan über ihre Symptome berichtete. Eine gründliche und strukturierte Anamneseerhebung ist daher unerlässlich, da Betroffene oft versuchen, ihre Symptome zu verheimlichen. Aus diesem Grunde wird die Erkrankung oft übersehen und meist erst spät diagnostiziert und behandelt. Unsere Patientin beklagte eine starke emotionale Belastung durch die Symptome der Emetophobie, zeigte Vermeidungs- und Sicherheitsverhalten und war in ihrer Lebensqualität und allgemeinen Funktionsfähigkeit erheblich eingeschränkt. Die Symptomatik unserer Patientin besserte sich nach Beginn der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie. Diese beinhaltete Wissensvermittlung durch Psychoedukation, eine Überprüfung und Korrektur dysfunktionaler Kognitionen, graduierte Expositionen sowie der Aufbau positiver Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen. Es besteht weiterer Bedarf an Forschung, um mehr über dieses noch recht unbekannte Krankheitsbild zu erfahren, das ebenso viel Leid und psychosoziale Einschränkungen versuchen kann wie andere schwere psychische Erkrankungen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 呕吐恐惧症指的是一种对呕吐产生的强烈且非理性的恐惧，属于特定恐惧症范畴。该病症目前研究较少，关于其病因和患病率知之甚少，也缺乏系统可靠的治疗方案。多数研究表明，呕吐恐惧症患者多为女性，童年早期发病，通常病程迁延，常伴随精神共病，且患者常因羞耻感而隐瞒病情。认知行为疗法（结合暴露与反应干预）是目前最有效的治疗手段。本文报告一例20岁女性病例，该患者最初因重度抑郁发作入院治疗。由于患者羞于主动陈述症状，识别呕吐恐惧症存在困难。因此必须进行系统化问诊，因为患者常刻意掩饰症状。这导致该病症易被漏诊，往往延迟确诊和治疗。本例患者因呕吐恐惧症承受巨大情绪压力，表现出回避行为与安全行为，生活质量和社会功能严重受损。在接受认知行为疗法（包括心理教育、纠正错误认知、分级暴露训练及建立积极自我效能感）后症状改善。针对这一尚不为人熟知的疾病——其引发的痛苦和社会功能损害不亚于其他严重精神疾病——仍需进一步研究探索。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 38295837 | specific phobia |

The pursuit of non-invasive brain stimulation provides a practical means of augmenting VRET. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, stimulates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with the potential to enhance the effects of exposure therapy. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine whether tDCS enhanced the effects of VRET in acrophobia. [METHOD]: This study recruited 64 college students with significant fear of height (based on the Acrophobia Questionnaire, AQ). Finally, 61 participants were randomly allocated to the tDCS active-stimulated group (n = 30) or the sham-stimulated group (n = 31). After stimulation, VRET was conducted, and clinical indices were recorded. The AQ was used as the first primary outcome, and Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) and the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ) were used as secondary outcomes. [RESULT]: There was a significant reduction in psychometric and behavioral anxiety measurements from pre to post treatment as indicated by main effects for the factor time (AQ-Anxiety: F (2.60) = 139.55, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.83; AQ-Avoidance: F (2.60) = 53.73, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.69; HIQ: F (2.60) = 128.12, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.81; STAI-Y-S: F (2.60) = 15.44, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.34; BAI: F (2.60) = 73.81, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.71). Compared with the sham-stimulated group, the reduction of AQ-Anxiety and SUDS in the first exposure trial (F (2,60) = 8.56, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.23; t = 2.34, p = 0.024, d = 0.61) was significantly faster in the active group. At follow-up, there was also a further reduction in AQ anxiety and avoidance (Anxiety: M = 56.51 ± 27.19; main effect time F (1,60) = 25.16, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.35; Avoidance: M = 12.57 ± 7.97; main effect time F (1,60) = 31.40, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.45) without interaction time*group (Anxiety: F (1.60) = 0.12, p = 0.740, η2 = 0.00; Avoidance: F (1.60) = 0.64, p = 0.430, η2 = 0.02).

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using Prolific Academic Ltd.®, an online survey platform. The survey was administered in August 2020 to English speaking adults (>17 years) in the United States who were registered with Prolific. The target sample was stratified to represent the demographics of the U.S. population. A validated, eight-item breast cancer fear scale was adapted to measure thyroid cancer-specific fear. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors significantly associated with high levels of thyroid cancer-specific fear. Results: Of the 1136 respondents (94.3% eligibility), 50.4% were female, 74.1% White, and the mean age was 45 years (SD = 16 years). Overall, 47.5% of respondents had high levels of thyroid cancer-specific fear. Multivariate regression demonstrated that age <40 years (OR = 2.46 vs. 65+ [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.60-3.80]) and female gender (OR = 1.48 vs. male [CI = 1.13-1.93]) were associated with high levels of thyroid cancer fear. Believing thyroid cancer (OR = 2.71 [CI = 1.99-3.69]) and cancer in general are serious (OR = 1.53 [CI = 1.13-2.08]) were also associated with high levels of thyroid cancer fear. Respondents who overestimated thyroid cancer incidence (OR = 1.64 [CI = 1.25-2.13]) and believed they had a high chance of developing cancer (OR = 1.70 [CI = 1.19-2.42]) were also more likely to have high fear of thyroid cancer. Conclusion: Thyroid cancer-specific fear is prevalent in U.S. adults particularly in females and those younger than 40 years. Because disease-specific fear is associated with overtreatment, targeted education about the seriousness, incidence, and risk factors for developing thyroid cancer may decrease public fear and possibly overtreatment related to "scared decision-making."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 背景：本研究旨在测量美国普通人群对甲状腺癌的恐惧程度，并识别与高水平甲状腺癌特异性恐惧相关的因素，这些因素可能导致过度治疗。方法：我们使用在线调查平台Prolific Academic Ltd.®进行了一项横断面调查。调查于2020年8月面向美国注册Prolific的英语成人（>17岁）开展，样本按美国人口 demographics 分层。采用经过验证的八项乳腺癌恐惧量表调整后测量甲状腺癌特异性恐惧。多变量逻辑回归分析识别与高水平甲状腺癌特异性恐惧显著相关的因素。结果：在1136名受访者中（94.3%符合条件），50.4%为女性，74.1%为白人，平均年龄45岁（标准差=16岁）。总体47.5%的受访者对甲状腺癌存在高水平恐惧。多变量回归显示，年龄<40岁（OR=2.46，对比65岁以上[95%置信区间{CI}=1.60-3.80]）和女性（OR=1.48，对比男性[CI=1.13-1.93]）与高水平甲状腺癌恐惧相关。认为甲状腺癌（OR=2.71 [CI=1.99-3.69]）和癌症总体严重（OR=1.53 [CI=1.13-2.08]）也与高水平恐惧相关。高估甲状腺癌发病率（OR=1.64 [CI=1.25-2.13]）或自评患癌风险高（OR=1.70 [CI=1.19-2.42]）的受访者也更可能对甲状腺癌存在高度恐惧。结论：美国成年人普遍存在甲状腺癌特异性恐惧，尤其是女性和40岁以下人群。由于疾病特异性恐惧与过度治疗相关，针对甲状腺癌的严重性、发病率和风险因素开展定向教育，或可降低公众恐惧，减少因"恐慌决策"导致的过度治疗。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 38115606 | specific phobia |

Management for this condition primarily focuses on addressing the musculoskeletal complaints using physiotherapy rather than the additional manifestations such as fatigue, anxiety and depression. This systematic review aims to identify psychological interventions and assess whether they improve the lived experiences of individuals with HSD. It also aims to assess which psychological interventions were most effective, which symptoms were most effectively managed by a psychological intervention, and whether there were differences between children and adults. Studies were included if they were a randomised controlled trial or pre/post-test design, a sample of any age and clinical diagnosis of HSD (including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), used a psychological intervention and assessed the effect of the intervention on lived experiences using appropriate outcome measures. Risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The results were narratively synthesised. Six studies were included in the review, one isolated psychological intervention and five incorporated a psychological intervention within a multidisciplinary programme. The interventions predominantly aimed to reduce pain including intensity, interference, pain-related fear and catastrophising, with anxiety and depression, affect, daily living, fatigue also being evaluated. The most beneficial psychological interventions were those delivered alongside physiotherapy in an outpatient or community setting, improving both the physical and psychological aspects of pain, subsequently improving quality of life. However, there lacks randomised controlled trials with larger samples to definitively confirm the significant findings discussed in this review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 过度活动谱系障碍（HSD）对患者的身体、心理及社会功能均产生影响，这使得评估和治疗变得困难。目前对该病症的治疗主要侧重于通过物理疗法解决肌肉骨骼问题，而非针对疲劳、焦虑和抑郁等其他症状。本系统综述旨在识别心理干预措施，并评估这些措施是否能改善HSD患者的生活体验，同时分析哪些心理干预最有效、哪些症状通过心理干预能得到最佳控制，以及儿童与成人患者之间是否存在差异。纳入标准包括：随机对照试验或前/后测设计研究、涵盖任何年龄样本且经临床诊断为HSD（含埃勒斯-当洛斯综合征）、采用心理干预措施并通过合适的结果指标评估干预对生活体验的影响。使用混合方法评估工具进行偏倚风险评估，结果采用叙述性综合法呈现。共纳入6项研究，其中1项为单纯心理干预，5项将心理干预纳入多学科治疗方案。干预措施主要针对减轻疼痛（包括疼痛强度、干扰度、疼痛相关恐惧和灾难化思维），同时评估焦虑抑郁、情绪状态、日常生活及疲劳改善情况。最有效的心理干预是与物理疗法相结合在门诊或社区环境中实施的方案，这类干预能同步改善疼痛的身心症状，从而提升生活质量。但现有研究缺乏大样本随机对照试验来确证本综述讨论的重要发现。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 38091036 | specific phobia |

Previous work has demonstrated that SAD is related to cannabis use in adults; however, less is known about what correlates relate to this association in emerging adults. A subsample of individuals ages 18-25 years old from the NESARC-III (N = 5194) was used to (a) evaluate the association between cannabis use and SAD and (b) examine what correlates may be associated with cannabis use and SAD in emerging adulthood. Weighted cross-tabulations assessed sociodemographics and lifetime psychiatric disorder prevalence estimates among the emerging adult sample. Multinomial logistic regressions examined associations between sociodemographics and psychiatric disorders and four groups (i.e., no cannabis use or SAD; cannabis use only; SAD only; cannabis use + SAD). The prevalence of co-occurring cannabis use and SAD was 1.10%. Being White, a part-time student, or not a student were associated with increased odds of having co-occurring cannabis use + SAD (OR range: 2.26-3.09). Significant associations also emerged between major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder and co-occurring cannabis use + SAD (AOR range: 3.03-19.05). Results of this study may have implications for better identifying and screening emerging adults who are at risk of co-occurring cannabis use and SAD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 大麻使用与社交焦虑障碍（SAD）在成年初显期较为普遍。已有研究表明，SAD与成人使用大麻有关，但关于成年初显期人群中这一关联的相关因素知之甚少。本研究采用NESARC-III中18-25岁个体的子样本（N=5194），旨在：（a）评估大麻使用与SAD之间的关联；（b）探讨成年初显期可能与大麻使用和SAD相关的因素。加权交叉表分析了该成年初显期样本的社会人口学特征及终生精神障碍患病率。多项逻辑回归检验了社会人口学特征、精神障碍与四组人群（即无大麻使用或SAD；仅使用大麻；仅患SAD；大麻使用+SAD）之间的关联。大麻使用与SAD共病的患病率为1.10%。白人身份、兼职学生或非学生身份与共病风险增加相关（OR值范围：2.26-3.09）。重性抑郁障碍、双相I型障碍、广泛性焦虑障碍、特定恐惧症、广场恐惧症和惊恐障碍也与大麻使用+SAD共病存在显著关联（AOR值范围：3.03-19.05）。本研究结果可能有助于更好地识别和筛查存在大麻使用与SAD共病风险的成年初显期人群。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 38061325 | specific phobia |

Unfortunately, challenges exist that impact the effective implementation of exposure-based CBT in clinical practice. One of the primary challenges is the accessibility and availability of exposure stimuli (e.g., spiders, storms, heights) in CBT sessions. Immersive virtual reality (VR) has shown promise as a scalable and sustainable solution to address this clinical need, but remains largely untested in youth with anxiety disorders. Here, we examine the use of VR exposures in the treatment of youth with an anxiety disorder (i.e., specific phobias). We aimed to investigate: (1) the feasibility and clinical benefit of VR exposures; (2) whether VR exposures elicit changes in physiological arousal and/or subjective distress; and (3) whether habituation serves as a mechanism across physiological and subjective outcomes for VR exposures. Three youth and their parents completed a clinical evaluation, which was followed by a one session treatment (OST) with VR exposures. Afterward, youth and parents completed clinical assessments one-week and 1-month after treatment. Immersive VR exposures were found to be feasible and demonstrated clinical benefit for reducing anxiety severity. Additionally, VR exposures elicited changes in both physiological and subjective outcomes. Finally, physiological habituation to VR exposures was observed among participants who exhibited treatment response at follow-up. Collectively, these findings demonstrate preliminary evidence that VR exposures are feasible, tolerable, and show some therapeutic benefit for treating youth with anxiety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 基于暴露的认知行为疗法（CBT）已被证明有效，并被推荐为儿童焦虑的一线治疗方法。然而，在临床实践中实施基于暴露的CBT仍存在一些挑战，其中最主要的挑战之一是在CBT治疗过程中难以获取和呈现暴露刺激（如蜘蛛、风暴、高度）。沉浸式虚拟现实（VR）技术作为一种可扩展且可持续的解决方案，有望满足这一临床需求，但在焦虑症青少年患者中的应用尚未得到充分验证。本研究探讨了VR暴露疗法在治疗青少年焦虑症（如特定恐惧症）中的应用。我们旨在研究：（1）VR暴露疗法的可行性和临床效果；（2）VR暴露是否会引起生理唤醒和/或主观痛苦的变化；（3）习惯化是否作为VR暴露疗法在生理和主观结果中的机制。三名青少年及其父母完成了临床评估，随后接受了一次包含VR暴露的单次治疗（OST）。治疗后一周和一个月，青少年及其父母再次完成了临床评估。研究发现，沉浸式VR暴露疗法具有可行性，并能有效减轻焦虑症状。此外，VR暴露疗法在生理和主观指标上均引发了显著变化。最后，在随访中表现出治疗反应的参与者身上观察到了对VR暴露的生理习惯化现象。这些发现初步证明，VR暴露疗法对治疗青少年焦虑症具有可行性、耐受性，并展现出一定的治疗效果。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 37985621 | specific phobia |
